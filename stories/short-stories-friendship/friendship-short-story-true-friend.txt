Once upon a time there was two boys named Ankit and Himanshu both were good friends and all grown up they completed their early education together. They both were moving to different countries for the sake of job so,they decided to meet at a restaurant for the last time. At the restaurant they both betted that after 10 years they both would meet at the same place and then they would see that who is more successful.

Time passed and the day came on which they booth had to met. The clock was showing 10:oo pm in the month of late December. A man wearing a over coat was waiting at the door of the restaurant. A light fall on him when he looked a policeman was coming towards him. Policeman asked to that man.

Policeman-Who are you?

That man-Sir i am a merchant waiting for someone

Policeman-for whom you are waiting?

That man-For my friend

Policeman-This is not safe here in night,you should leave now

That man-Sir i would leave after waiting for my friend

Policeman leave from there, after a while that person saw another person coming towards him.That waiting person said in hesitation are you ankit?

Reply come from him was a yes.

Then they talked and enjoyed their meal.

In conversation Ankit asked to that man who was Himanshu what he do

Himanshu-I am a gold merchant and you

Ankit-Just a manager of a small company

The conversation continued and in the conversation Himanshu realized that the person he think is Ankit is not ankit and he asked him in a very rude manner who are you.

After hearing this he jumped of himanshu and cached him. He was a policeman and he give him a note and hianshu read it, in the note

Hello Himanshu, i am ankit and i came to met you, i was the policeman you saw, when i saw you i found the most wanted smuggler instead of my friend. It was very hard for me to catch my own friend that’s why i leave and sent this officer to catch you.
