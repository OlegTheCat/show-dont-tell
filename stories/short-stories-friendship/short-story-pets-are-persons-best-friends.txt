I always had difficulties in communicating with people, mostly because my dad never allowed me to make close friendships, so I grew up with the fact that people can’t be trusted. I spent most of my early childhood alone with no bestfriend except my little bunny, but as years past by I started to make friends, especially at college.

But the results I came out with was that everyone needs you for a reason, to fill place, to waste time, or even to have a company, none really cares about what you need, and when life decides to give you a hill of a time, all those so called friends disappear, but what I noticed throughout my short life that no matter how depressed I feel I will find my pets around me.  I had different pets throughout the years, from bunnies , birds, cats, hamsters, to my one and only turtle (speedy).

I will never forget the day when I was so tired of life and I was lying down in my room, when Speedy came to me and simply tugged itself under me and slept there. That accident gave me so much gratitude and I felt for the first time that I am loved and there is someone who cares, and for the record it wasn’t that only case that happened and showed me that my pets care for my feelings.

There were many times when my other pets did exactly the same but in their own ways, like when I was sitting next to my parrot’s (beauty) cage while I wasn’t in my best mood at all. It stopped playing and came to sat closer to me and did nothing but watching me.

So that’s why in my opinion and with my experience pets are a person’s best friends.
