Short Story about Just friends

Friendship is one best feature in life! When you’re a kid, everyone is your friend. As you grow, things turn lopsided. The one you thought would stand firm becomes a mere spectator. That’s what happened! I just had a handful of ten friends when I was about 10. Walking with that gang of interesting people became a past time.

As we grew, things turned different. Ten became 3. We did realize things had changed, that we were all different. The priorities of past became mere desires. People don’t understand. They don’t know that everyone’s life is different and so the way the react is different. But people see you in the same way. We try to ape from the West in most of the things, but mind set? I feel this mentality becomes a hindarance. As time passed, things became even clear. Its true to say “good wall make good neighbours” but somehow, people don’t really understand!

When Sonia, Sohail and I started realising that people saw us pretty weirdly, I got a bad cue! A point in time when Sonia shifted to Canada, I didn’t know what was in store for us! A bad eye. No, never did any of us have lust in our relation. We were just friends. And people couldn’t take it. The fact that a girl and boy were friends somehow, was like an ugly leitmotif. Even when we didn’t have a tinch of dirt, the oogling eyes of people destroyed us.

“We are just friends!” We kept reassuring to people but that went unheard. That’s how I learnt Sociology and yes, seriously,”we are and were and will be just friends”.
