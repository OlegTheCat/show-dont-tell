Friends Short Story – A House of devil

Two men were sitting leisurely in the hall room. Each occupied in his own thought. In the television a muted film was playing to which no attention was being paid. The languor of the room maintained a harmony with the turbulence outside owing to its indifference. A cluster of dark clouds had obscured the sun and so the tangerine light coming in the room through the glass window vanished suddenly. The variation of light caught the attention of one of the men and he spoke after being reminded of something,

‘the light of the stairways are out. We need to buy a new one’

‘when did it go out?’

‘today in the afternoon’

‘why was it on in the afternoon?’

‘I put it on accidentally and noted it was out’

‘I hope you weren’t in illusion by the sunlight. It makes the stair light insignificant’

‘it was cloudy today.. more dark, so I could see clearly’

‘ did you put it on and off few times. Some times the switch is not properly pressed’

‘yes, I did check it… instinctively’

‘well then, we do need a new light for our stairway’

‘it is late for the day. We will get it tomorrow. i think we can manage without it today’

‘yes, we can but tomorrow is our work day. We won’t be able to get it, like today’

‘then we have to wait till we get a holiday. There are good 3-4 days left, only then we can get it from the market’

‘I guess, if we can get used to it for 3-4 days we get do it for a longer period too’

They both looked at each other and smiled at the notion. The television was put off mute now and the characters from the film began to speak. The cluster of clouds had passed and the fading sunlight entered the room again.
