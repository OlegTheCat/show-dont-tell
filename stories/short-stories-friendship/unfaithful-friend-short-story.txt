Short Story Friendship – The Unfaithful Friend

The story had begun earlier.

“Tere jaisa yaar kha, kha aisa yaarana…”, Jai sang as the audience stared at Rohan to whom it was dedicated.

 Their friendship was by now popular and talked about in the premises of the college.

“Yaad karegi duniya, tera mera afsana…”, he winked at Rohan.

Their deeds brought recognition but no fun, and misdeeds resulted into punishments but gifted memories to keep. They sat at the last bench gossiping about their crushes, but not all day.

“Tere sang jeena yha, tere sang mar jana…”, he swayed lightly and happily.

 It was so vividly portrayed in his expressions, these lines. Once he broke his leg while biking, as a novice. Rohan took to the scene, helped him to the hospital and even convinced about his well-being to his parents. Such was their friendship!

However, the story wanted some twists!

Jai was an elite at studies, Rohan was not. The session was about to end, and Jai was ready with his thesis. The thesis was a masterpiece.

 Rohan stole his thesis, submitted it prior to the date and went on to earn world recognition and reputation.

 Jai’s mistake: he had discussed his thesis with Rohan. Neither did he claimed on his thesis. He was struck deep by the unexpected.

Jai has since become mentally ill and schizophrenic. Moreover, his family abandoned him, and now he wanders around the streets. People know about him, they give him food and offer shelter though he humbly refuses. He writes poems about his friend and glues them randomly over walls and posts of the street. He is 32 years old and believes that his friend shall realise his mistake and return.

Once I read one of his poems, at the end it was written:

“Yaara teri yaari ko, maine to khuda mana…

 Yaad karegi duniya, tera mera afsana…”

In wish of twists, the story sadly ruined a character’s life.
