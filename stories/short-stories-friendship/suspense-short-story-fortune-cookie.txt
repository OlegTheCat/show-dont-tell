It was cold, and I was shivering. The mist obstructed my sight. We all decided to savor China’s famous fortune cookies. A fortune cookie is a cookie with a piece of paper in it, which predicts your future. I paid 1 yaun and received 1 cookie. I was excited about my fortune. I opened the piece of paper, but to my disappointment, everything was written in Chinese. However, Thanks to the technology that made words easy. It translated “Get away from here, do not stay here, and better you don’t tell this to anyone, or else…”

I was terrified. I decided to tell this to my buddies. I told them, and they were shocked. We all decided to leave from China and return to India. We were travelling on the AH42. The horror and the panic is still reserved in our minds. We thought to stop to ask for the right route. But to our horror, the brakes failed.

The car was just going further, without any stop. My friend was an expert in driving. He is very skillful and a talented driver. He owned a cab and everyone preferred to hop on into his cab due to his safe driving. So, we thought he could do something and help us. But we were completely wrong. The steering went out of his control and we just dashed into a gas station. KABOOM! The car exploded and everything was in fire. The gas station has just turned into a horrifying fire storm. Everyone were running with fear.

Just then, I heard a scream. “Nadine, just wake up fast, you need to finish your project”. I jumped out of my bed with a distressing look on my face. I saw my friends all safe and alive. I just whispered to myself “ It is just a silly dream.”
