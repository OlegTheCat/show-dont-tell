“Excuse me….. Sir Kashif, I don’t want to play any more…. I am tried”, I told my teacher with a nasty feeling of weakness as though I was going to faint. Before he could reply the bell rang and everyone ran towards the class .

“Wait,I can smell the gas leakage.I guess it’s from the heater”, I yelled as we entered the class.  Everyone stepped out but Alice was too impatient to wait. She ran in and ignoring everyone’s warning she turned on all the lights . And the next thing was a blast. The class was on fire.

The Principal, the teachers and the custodians dared towards the classroom but no one dared to enter the mouth of death. Soon, frightened Alive screamed “Help…help….I am burning…..”. And then there was no other word. We couldn’t see her because of the sense smoke, but everyone was certain that Alice has died. The fire continued.

The chemistry lab was adjacent to our class,it was on fire too. We were asked to leave the schools building .

With eyes full of tears, I said to principal,”Alice is inside ma’am. We can’t just go out for our safety leaving her burning inside. Let me go in and help her”.

“Are you in your senses? How can we let you go into the mouth of death? Go out, the fire fighters are here to save her”, the principal yelled , in a stern tone.

The tears rolled down my cheeks as I headed toward the gate.

I wanted to go in but wasn’t allowed to , but still I did what I was able to. I didn’t give up hopes and kept on praying for my best friend’s life. When the fire was put off, I ran towards our classroom . My legs trembled as I saw. The world seemed to close on me. All the moments, I spent with Alice came rushing to my mind.

The wicked fire was extinguished but in took Alice’s life with it. Alive left this harsh world, leaving me alone. And I was left with life full of remorse and sorrows.
