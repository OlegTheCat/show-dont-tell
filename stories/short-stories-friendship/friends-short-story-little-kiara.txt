“Hey Ridz.. what are you doing?”

“Social network sites kiara.. its in nowadays.. you should also try..”

Kiara is a 13yrs old girl.. she trusts her best friend Ridz blindly.. Ridzi has started using a new social network site named Fabuk.. And kiara also did the same..

The two made many new friends.. Ridzi being very innocent met Rajveer online.. She got very close to him in no time.. but not as friends.. She found an elder brother in him.. &; Rajveer a younger sister in Ridz..

Kiara had lost her best friend.. Ridzi always used to forget about kiara when she met new people.. but kiara never felt bad about it.. Rajveer fell in love with Kiara.. but little kiara also saw an elder brother in Rajveer.. so Rajveer took his steps back..

“Heyoo Ridz.. this is Rajat.. i am Rajveer’s cousin brother.. he told me a lot about you and kiara.. and I would love to be your friend.. but mark my word FRIEND.. not brother..”

“Hehe yeah.. it would be a pleasure.. so tell me about yourself..” replied Ridz

Ridz has always been alone.. her parents were out most of the time and she had only one friend ie kiara.. this was the reason why she made more and more of online friends.. Rajat and Ridzi also became very good friends.. Ridzi felt secured when she used to chat with Rajveer and Rajat..

Kiara was left alone.. so she spent her time on Fabuk.. (fabuk was her best timepass whenever she felt lonely).

 

“Kiara, I don’t know when you did this to me.. but I think I love you..” said Rajat

“But.. I don’t even know you properly.. how can I .. . . .” Kiara was replying, when Ridz said in between ” Kiara , my bff.. if you trust me.. don’t let this opportunity go.. Rajat is a very very nice guy.. he will keep you happy always..”

Kiara had to agree after seeing her bestest buddy begging in front of her..

She decided to talk to Rajveer about this mess.. coz she felt he could help her out of this.. but soon she also started liking Rajat..

She confessed it to Rajat “I really have started liking you a lot.. I hope you will be mine forever”

“Sure my baby” Rajat said..

All were happy specially Kiara.. A perfect boyfriend.. lovely friend.. and a caring brother..

 

“Kiara.. please go away from my life.. ur a b****.. never ever try to contact me.. I am breaking up with you..”

Kiara could not understand what was wrong.. but those last words were with her.. she cried that night.. it was her birthday the next day..

Ridzi consoled her.. and just like a lovely best friend she helped her to get back on track.. Kiara decided to see the brighter side.. she was still blessed with a best friend she could always trust.. and a very good brother who is always there for her..

 

Kiara got Ridz diary..

“Why ? Why me always… how can kiara be so perfect? Good in studies.. beautiful.. so many friends.. and everyone favourite..

I lyk Rajat.. but she took him away..

Even rajveer.. my brother, he cares for kiara..

But I’ll set everything in my favour..

I promise”

Kiara felt guilty she was almost in tears..

 But she controlled..

Then suddenly

 Ridzi’s phone rang..

 It was Rajat..

 ” hello my sweetypie ridzi.. how your doing..

 I have planned something for our 3 months anniversary..”

Ridzi came running as she heard her cell ring..

 Bt she was late. .. she saw kiara in tears… and tried to explain..

 ” I wanted to tell everything to uh.. bt..”

Kiara n Rajat broke up last month.. and Rajat n Ridzi were together from last 3 months.. kiara could not understand who cheated her? Rajat or Ridzi..

Again she cried whole night.. her childhood friend.. her chuddy buddy.. her bff.. da one she trusted blindly.. betrayed her..

Kiara and Ridzi were no more friends.. kiara tried to avoid Ridzi whenever she came to apologise..

But 1 day.. it was different.. Ridzi was in tears.. her apology seemed real that day..

 ” Oh kiara.. my dear kiara.. m sorry.. please.. he was rajveer.. there is no Rajat.. Rajveer confessed it to me.. now we are not together.. I left him.. please kiara.. I am alone..”

Its been years now..

Rajveer has moved on.. he does not even care about kiara or ridz..

Ridzi also suffered but now she is happy now with some other guy..

Kiara and Ridzi are still friends..

 But many things are not the same as before..

 Kiara !!

 She is not that bubbly as before… she interacts very less.. she is afraid of making new friends.. and can not trust anyone.. but still she is trying her best..

But the good thing in all is that

 Kiara now is well aware about her priorities..
