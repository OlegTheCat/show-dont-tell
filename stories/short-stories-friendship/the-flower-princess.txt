Alexis and Jasmin

My name is Alexis and I am 26. One evening, I was inside a store that sells movies. It was just me and another customer there, Jasmine. I did not know her name and I had never met her. She was one of the most magical girls I have ever seen. When she was standing a few feet away putting back a movie I spontaneously said.

“No! That’s fantastic, it’s a great movie about two American and two French adventurer. They do cool and awesome things, they travel around the world for a whole year.”

Jasmin said.

“Okay, I’ll take it then. I really want to travel the world for a year.”

I said.

“I have just enough money for that, for the both of us. So if you can go tonight, we can travel the world and do that kind of things as in the movie.”

Jasmin said.

“Yes, that would be awesome, can we really go tonight?”

I said.

“Yes.”

Jasmin said.

“Okay, see you at the airport?”

I said.

“Yes, at midnight.”

We had the most awesome and magical adventure like when we jumped off a cliff by a waterfall. I was next to Jasmin in the air. I thought it was bad that we did not film everything and made a movie of it. We filmed and took pictures of everything but it is not like a movie. When I came back it was different, many looked, pointed and knew my name. I did not understand why, when I asked inside a store they told me that Jasmin is a famous blogger and that she had put up all the pictures and videos we had taken during the trip on the blog. We took so many pictures and recorded many videos during that year. The readers knew everything from the beginning and got to see it all, they also knew that I knew nothing. That was why non of my friends or family members ever revealed anything but everyone knew.
