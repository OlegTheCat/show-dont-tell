My story - Short Story

[My story – A Short Story]

I once  had a friend, a close friend ,I took him where he wanted to go, once he said “to the  depths   of the sea”, and there I took him,  he told me “to the  skies up above” , even there , “from the highest mountain top ,I want to see the world” .I showed him, he wasn’t  pleased, “higher!” he demanded .I took him  where he stood king of all mountains ,  seeing  all mountains on the face of the earth, he  turned to me  saying  “now the deepest  valley”  I  showed him ,he saw them all.

He wanted to hear the flap of a butterfly’s wings ,I told  him to listen,” I want to understand what I hear In the ocean’s voice” ,I told him to be quite .He wanted to  listen  to the wind and hear it’s story, I  told him to lend it  his earn .He looked at me  saying “I want to hear  what the crickets say at night, the  frogs and such things”, he heard  them all.

“Let me smell fresh morning flowers or the Scent of the sweetest  one, all to my heart’s content”, I  told him to take a deep breath, well satisfied .He turned to me again and said “if possible let touch all the biggest  gold  pieces and diamonds in the world” ,   I told he to stretch out his hands.

“But wait a minute , all this time I’ve been asking for such things to see ,to touch ,to smell, to hear, but I forgot one thing, let me see you ,I have never seen you”. I said to him “All these things I’ve shown you, yet you ask  to see me, you  didn’t see me yet ,did you? I turned to him ,he saw not, smelt not, touched not….never again.
