 from 

-Anam: Innocent, average looking girl cares a lot for other people even if the other person betrays her. Secret admirer but would love to tell the whole world. She loves to make other comfortable around her.

-Yusuf: Gemini personality: Complicated person to understand, stands out of crowd. Like every girl’s dream guy. Loves to make everyone laugh and make fun of his friends. Not a type of person who can you be serious with. Can be like a child and mature at times. Very egoistic and thinks whatever he does is right.

-Gauhar: Looks very innocent and cute, talks very sweetly, can easily make friends by using her sweet tongue. selfish and 2 faced. Can go on any height to get what she wants.

-Sana: One of the prettiest girl in the college. Full of attitude but likes to stay within her group of friends.

-Sanjana: The Hindu tamil of the group,  innocent and childlike. Loves to have fun

 

First day of college. Anam decides to join badminton. Her first day at badminton club. The hall is filled with  guys and girls. She is nervous. She finds few girls playing on one court and she decides to join them. Then this 16 yr old boy called Yusuf  decides to join in, taking Anam’s racquet. She fell in love with him at first sight. He didn’t seem to notice her much as she wasn’t like other girls.

Days and months passed, she kept on seeing him everywhere in college. At her bus stop, outside her class, in canteen. But she didn’t had guts to talk to him and she never thought she would ever be able to talk to him.

 One day Anam’s close friend Sanjana introduced her to her boyfriend, and with him was Yusuf. Her eyes were just surprised, while Yusuf’s eyes didn’t get off this beautiful girl Sana. She was very beautiful and Anam wasn’t. That day she realised he already love some one.

Day by day Anam and Yusuf got close. They were like best friends. They talked whole day long. She Used to wake up to his good morning message, and sleep with his good night text. She lived her whole life in each moment. Anam imagined her whole life with him, even her friends thought Yusuf loves Anam back. Yusuf treated anam in very different way. They shared their deepest secret and during college days they would sit in library. Talking and laughing. Yusuf loved talking to Anam, his day wouldn’t go pass without talking to her. The same thing was with Anam.

But his eyes were still on Sana’s beauty so for best friend’s sake, she decided to help Yusuf talk to Sana. But it backfired as Sana and Yusuf were not made for each other. Still this broke her down each day. So  Slowly he distanced away from her. Anam got more and more depressed, her life was fully changing. Many questions raised in her mind as she had no idea why Yusuf was doing this.

It was summer term when they didn’t meet each other but talked daily on whatsapp. But not like before. Everything suddenly seemed to became dull. She met him after summer term, where this new character called Gauhar came in.  Gauhar was Yusuf’s sister’s friend. Anam and Gauhar were good friends. They talked on whatsapp, were together in college. Anam would tell everyone about her feelings including to Gauhar. She exactly knew how much Anam loves Yusuf.

One day Anam saw Yusuf and Gauhar together, she knew Gauhar had feelings for Yusuf too because the way her behaviour was towards him. So Anam decided teasing Gauhar to get the truth out. And Gauhar admitted she loves Yusuf way more than Anam. Anam was shattered. Not because she loves him too but she backstabbed her. She stopped talking to Gauhar.

Many days passed, Gauhar and Yusuf were always seen together. Anam had no clue what was going on. Untill she saw them kissing outside the college. For many days she cried a lot, she got very quiet. Her friends motivated her to stay strong. She always had this feeling that Yusuf would come to her and tell her that he loves her back. But that didn’t happen. Yusuf and Anam had stopped talking way long back since Gauhar came in his life.

College was ending. 1 day before the final exam, Anam tried to muster some guts and went up to talk to Yusuf.  Anam and her best friend and Yusuf and Gauhar were the only ones there. She tried to ask him why he did this? What had went wrong? What mistake did she do? She was shocked to find out all her friends who she thought were her closest friends had back chatted about her. They made her look like the evil one and selfish one when she was the most selfless one.

She tried to clarify herself but she was too shocked to utter anything. She bursted out crying and ran to the toilet. She couldn’t tolerate her love going away from her like this all because of Gauhar.
