“You okay?”

“Yeah. I’m fine.”

“You sure? You don’t look so well.”

“No. I’m fine, thanks.”

“It’s cold out here. I think you better come with me; I’ll drop you wherever you -”

“No it’s okay. I’ll fetch a cab.”

“You sure? It’s pretty late.”

“So?”

“So… I mean that you won’t find a cab at a time like this.”

“I’ll manage.”

“It’s almost four; let me help you girl.”

“Whatever. There’s gonna be some open diner or shop somewhere. I’ll walk. I’ll manage.”

“The only thing that opens this late-”

“Is my legs, right?”

“What?”

“‘cause that’s what you’re after, you slime!”

“What? Oh come on! Do you actually treat everyone with such hostility?”

“Yeah. Hostility. I don’t treat them by dropping my pants and spreading my legs, okay? So better luck next girl.”

“No! I will ~not~ calm down. Just get lost.”

“Okay. Okay.”

“Oh god… I don’t feel so good.”

“Here. Let of help you. I’ll take you to some doc.”

“No! Don’t come any closer. Don’t you dare touch me. I don’t need your hands, your car or your frigigin doc!”

“Okay. Easy. Easy, alright? ”

“Not against the car!”

“Sorry.”

“Seriously? My dad’s gonna kill me.”

“You actually live with your parents?”

“Yep… guess that makes me a douche.”

“No it doesn’t. I think it’s cute.”

“Cute, huh? Except that I hate him.”

“I’m a cop, actually.”

“Cop, huh? I do like a guy in uniform. So where’s yours? ”

“Oh don’t worry. I’m off-duty. I won’t arrest you.”

“You can’t.”

“Pardon?”

“You can’t arrest me even if you want.”

“You’re that fast, huh?”

 

“Oh yeah! You know, I always wanted to be a cop.”

“No kidding… to stand up for justice, eh?”

“Nah! To shoot some goons in the guts!”

“Well, I don’t think they make bullet-proof bras.”

“Shut up.”

“Really?”

“No.”

“Okay.”

“Kiss me.”

“Oh I’d love to.”

“Now… with a drink out me the question, can I buy you dinner? ”

“Oh you can buy me breakfast!”
