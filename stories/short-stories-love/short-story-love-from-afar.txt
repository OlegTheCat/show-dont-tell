Short Story – Love from Afar

 from 

His class was downstairs and mine, up. Till the time we were together and when he used to come up. He had a reason. Me. And I knew it. But now when he comes to the floor, I don’t find a reason. I could say, his friends, new girl or anything but my hearts denies. Another reason could be, he still likes me but somehow this thought never goes with my heart. Sometimes, yes, he does and sometimes no, it could never be.

When I fit in my life perfectly without him, it feels like it’s all over. Finally. No more thorns. Finally, I could smile again. But every once in a while, it comes back and I remember how I lost the only person I’ve ever loved and then I realize I still do.

Even now when I think of “us”, it doesn’t hurt much or I don’t feel like mentioning. I don’t know. But even now if he comes to me and look into my eyes, I’d happily fall for him without even thinking for a moment how he purloined my happiness for a while. I guess this is what they talk about.

Attachment. Maybe this is it. Maybe this is what everyone looks for.

Sometimes I find completely lost in situations where I’d always planned to be with him. Where I stand alone now begging him to hold my hand and give it a chance. It’s been two years but even today there’s not a single moment when he doesn’t cross my mind. And.

Me? Well.

 Sometimes, you’re not supposed to fall in love and even if you fall you are only supposed to miss them.

 Care for them.

 Smile at them.

 And only wish to be with them.

 Only beg them to hold your hand.

 Only wish to be missed back.

 Only look at them from a far.

 For .

Sometimes who you think is your life is not the ONE.

 Sometimes you’re supposed to a wait a bit more .
