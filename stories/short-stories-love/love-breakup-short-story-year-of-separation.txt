Love Short Story – A year of Separation

On this very day a year back when I imagine myself of how miserable , pathetic, torn apart and broken up I was, just because you firmly thought of deleting me from your life. You planned on moving onto big things and the promises you did, the dreams we had together had now became the solo ride of your unicycle.

I remember how desperate I was to get you back in my life, every wildest and craziest idea I had in mind implementing it so that you take a leap of faith and love me back, crying my ass of every single moment , you will not believe but I even planned on ending my life, because I never imagined a life without you. What a sh##ful mess I was, you know but all those tears that came out in the utter loneliness of darkness, the wasting of hours of reliving the past moments in my mind , every second seeming like an hour was something the hardest , it felt like everything was to an end, but somehow I remember how prudently I started explaining my anger and sadness in the words through my pen , I wrote and wrote stories , about you , your smell , your hairs and somehow it came to be appreciated .

It’s been an year when you lost me from your life, but eventually I want to express my sincere thanks that made me the strongest person within, it gave me a unending approach of positive and a mission to spread love, explain what is love. When someday I meet you , while you roam with your newly significant other hand in hand , that it doesn’t hurt anymore, I don’t cry anymore and it makes you relive and overcome your shortcomings because “love”, these 4 letter words might not have meant to you , maybe my love was insecure and overprotected buy my actions were never to hurt you in my deepest desires. I can’t love anyone like I did but I would pray for the person you gave your heart too and would pray you never go through that pain I did , coz after a year all the sadness it vanishes and all you are left with a stone heart with lots of kindness to make people to fall in love but never to try for oneself coz baby I’m still scared I lost you.

I promised you I would be there for you and I am, it’s just I feel if I will be there to look after you, what will your lover do to look after you ?
