Sumit was enjoying the warmth of a winter morning sitting in an easy chair in his veranda after getting prepared for another day’s work and silently watching the hurried people on the street. It was his daily routine to sit there for some time and watch the crowd in the front street. Everybody is in hurry to pursue their own dream, dream which will lead them to live a happy life. ‘Dream’ and ‘Hope’, these two are the most fascinating words for him from his early days. Dream to swim against the stream and hope that you have the potential to accomplish it, makes one’s life fruitful.

‘Papa it has already crossed 10.00. We are getting late’, a sweet voice awoke him from his dreamy world. Titir, his twelve years old adopted daughter was always conscious about her father’s daily routine. He adopted Titir when she was two years old from an orphan home in the city after getting a job in the University. A decade passed after that, she is grown up now, grown up enough to take care of her lonely father. He also did his best as a father to take care of her. He never tried to hide anything and told everything about her identity. She did not rebel rather she accepted the harsh truth quietly. After that, Sumit never let her realize the scarcity of his affection towards her.

‘Papa what are you thinking? Aren’t you feeling well?’ she put her palm gently on his forehead.

‘I am absolutely fine beta.’ He took her palm inside his hand and kissed it.

‘Beta, I was thinking about my little princess who is growing up. I have to find out a prince who will always make my little princess smiling.’

‘Papa, promise me you will never say like this. I will never leave you, the best Papa in the world?’ she embraced her father with all her strength.

‘OK beta. I don’t. Leave me now, I will find out someone who will stay with us. Is that fine?’

‘OK, I have to think about it. Papa I forgot, our housemaid found out an old reddish diary while she was cleaning some of your old books, accidentally it got wet a little, I have put it on your table in the reading room.’

‘I will take care of that beta.’ He got distracted a little while saying this. A sudden attraction to see the diary made him walk to his reading room. He carefully ran his fingers on the top cover. Side corners which were adorned with thin metallic wrapping got rusted; the red cover wore at several places revealing the hard sheet beneath it. He read the first page which was written- “

”, title of the diary. Some past memories of his early days got brightened and made him separated from the outside world. It was not so easy to forget those days, the days full of endless misery which forced him to experience a dark side of human life.

‘Papa we are already late’. He did not even notice when she came inside and stood beside him with her school bag.

‘I am ready beta.’ He replied being little disconnected with the conversation and closed the diary in haste to hide it from her.

‘Papa what is this diary about?’ She asked in a softened voice comprehending the gravity of the situation. At this small age, she has the compassion to realize some specific scenario about human deed. Might be, god has made her sensible enough to withstand against the odds that life had already put once after her birth.

‘Nothing, it’s about my childhood. Let’s go beta’, it revealed his futile effort to suppress the truth.

‘Ok papa. Sometimes I would like to listen from you’, She replied softly to realize the uneasiness in his quick and brief reply. It lessened the awkward feeling which started to aggrandize in him. After keeping the diary on his table, he started to walk towards the garage while adjusting his shoulder bag.

‘Beta have you checked your notebooks and other essentials properly? I am too late to recheck’; he started the engine of his new Maruti SX4. It already crossed eleven while he entered the class after dropping her to the school on the way to his university. Sumit is having a good reputation not only among his colleagues but students also respect a lot due to his refined behavior and vast knowledge on the subject. In his ten years of teaching life, he received several accolades in research and has established himself as a renowned face in his area of study.

Today is going to be the one of the rough day, he thought while entering to the lecture room. Some memories were haunting him and made him distracted from his concentration. After finishing the day’s work in a hurry, he returned home to get relaxed and forget those memories which frighten him the most.

Two hours left to take her back from school, he checked the time in his old wristwatch which he usually likes to wear even though the wearing of wristwatch was getting obsolete now a days. Some sweet memories were enwrapped behind this old, you can say ancient one as it was more than fifteen years old and he protected it from every possible danger. The hesitation in his mind to go through the diary won the battle. In a hurry, he prepared a cup of coffee filling his big size coffee mug. He turned over the first page and started to read while taking a sip in a leisured posture….

 

 

He doesn’t know why he was reading this but something was forcing him to do that. Many years passed, the invisible scars deep inside his sensitive mind started to heal with time. He wanted to forget that part of life and tried to bury under the burden of his so-called fulfilled and contended life. He flipped through another page by turning several pages in-between.

Sumit can clearly remember her last words when she came with her elder brother sitting on their scooty which usually she used to drive, without any initiation she started saying-

‘You are not worth of my love. I just loved you as a friend, but never thought to spend my life with you. How dare you to tell me as your girlfriend? You, the looser don’t have even any job to survive. And if you truly love me never try to come in my way after this.’ Without any pause in-between, she uttered those words in a flow holding her breadth, like she memorized those lines with a great effort and wanted to deliver it as early as possible. Without waiting to get a reply, she left the place instantly. She didn’t even look back for once to see him.

He got befuddled with the sudden change in her behavior; it took a little time to realize the reality of the incident. It left him shocked and speechless for moments, a fear to lose her paralyzed him.

He skipped another few pages in confusion; it seemed he was in a dilemma to decide which one to read.

,

It took a little time to overcome his emotional breakdown. After, near about six months of confinement in a room, he decided to start his life again. He wanted to heal the wound with the pride of achieving an enviable prosperity and dignity and at the same time to take a silent revenge on her parents.

Sumit took a last big sip of his coffee which already turned into a cold one; he kept the mug on the table with a gentle noise.  He checked the time again and immersed into the reminiscence.

Tears rolled down from his eyes, a feeling of emptiness grabbed his heart. After so long, he was crying. He achieved everything whatever he wanted but it was not enough to heal the wound inside his heart.

‘Is he ever tried to find her out? What if she is still now unmarried and leading a miserable life waiting to get him back. What if she is separated from her hubby and living alone. Just because she told not to find her out, he has not even tried to inquire about her. Might be she is afraid of his fame and prosperity to come back to him.’ Thousands of possibilities started occupying in his confused mind.

‘What if she is married and living happily?’

The thought suddenly appeared and tried to dominate over others. Slowly it made him restless and triumphed over all the positive possibilities that were showing a ray of hope a few moments ago.

‘If that happen, he will not go in front of her to create any problems in her life. That is what he also wants to see her happy. He has already learned to live in adversities and emerged as a winner.’ He furiously skipped rest of the pages after that and reached the last page of his diary.

 

Sumit closed the diary and put it down on the table, a sigh of despair came out without his concern. He copied all these letters to this diary waking nights after nights. A sudden thought allured him to think about it again. This time he is confident enough to take the final decision. From his phone, he found out the number that one of his friends gave him to contact after taking the decision.

‘Hello Prakash Publisher, this is Sumit Banerjee calling, I got your number from my friend Ashok. I want to publish my ——’

‘Ohh at last, your friend told me everything about it few months ago. Are you free tomorrow? I would like to meet with you to discuss about it.’

Sumit doesn’t know why he is so keen to do it this time. One of his friends first gave the idea to publish it to help emotionally ill people in conquering their battle. Somehow he managed to subside his temptation but not anymore. Is he really wanted to help those people who are struggling with depression or the last hope that someday she will read it? Whatever it maybe he will not look back. A contended feeling rushed through his body. Suddenly everything was appearing to bring a new hope, not necessarily has to be a successful one but the hope itself enough to live rest of his life and he also doesn’t want to die with the regret of not taking his final decision.
