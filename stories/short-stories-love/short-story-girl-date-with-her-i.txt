Short Story – On a date with her I

The night’s silence enveloped her. She snuggled in to its warmth. Every thing was still and quiet. She was with her self. Calm. Connected. On a date with her I. Me talking to me.

The clock was a curious by stander. Making its unwanted presence felt by constantly ticking away. Every second. Every heart beat. Every pulse. But she stood there. Under the stillness. She had met herself after a long day.

The lists and accounts could wait for a few more hours. But not she. Not her I. This was a one off date. That no one would know about. That no one would ever know about.

She and herself were together. There was no mirror to look at. She didnt need one. She could look into her own eyes through the quiet. She could read her own mind. Listen to what the heart had to say.

Routines, schedules could wait for a while. If not longer. It would be forever before she would get to meet herself again. Forever would be till the next night. An earthly cycle of 24 hours. After an entire day spent in the world. Filled with relations, connections, rituals, promises, work, emotions, physics and chemistry.

The I would sit in the back seat. Waiting for the rest of the segments to have played their roles. I would always wait. I had the smallest part in that 1 day. But when the I took the stage. There was silence. There was a connection. I has no speaches to narrate. No dialogues. No story line to follow. I flew with the flow. And thats why, She had be the only viewer of the show.

I was precious. They had just met. She and herself. 3 decades. And she didn’t know that the I even existed. Why did it take so long? To reach this calm place? To connect? To be with herself? May be? May be not? But. What if the decades had been years? Or the years had been months? May be then?

She would have been happy. Or sad. May she would have smiled. Or danced. Or gone skating. Or flown away on imaginary wings. Who knows what would have happened? But then her I would have ruled. Been on top of the world. Her world.

As they say, all is well that ends well. She has met herself. Better late than never. Better now than ever. She knew her me.

Let her sleep. With eyes wide open. With sights locked. With smiles shining brighter than diamonds.
