Love Short Story – Dark Secret

“Dark Secret”

Everywhere I go, I see a vision….

a mirage in the midst of a parched desert.

Something that I long for but am not even allowed to think about.

And yet slowly I die inside,

Yearning even for a glimpse of that mirage…

Everywhere I look,

I see him in my mind’s eye..I wish with all my heart that I can just be allowed to miss him.

My hand shakes and my body scorches,

thirsts for a replay.

Another chance to relive the scenes in my not so distant past.

 

Somewhere in the deepest abyss of my soul,

is a muffled voice that cries out this yearning,

And yet I hope nobody will ever hear me,

For I am not allowed to be heard.

 

He is the mirage in my parched desert.

And I walk aimlessly…

until I find him again even for just another glimpse…

Yes, this hope is what keeps me alive, for now.
