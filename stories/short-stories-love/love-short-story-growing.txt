Love Short Story – Growing Up

© Anand Vishnu Prakash, YourStoryClub.com

Nandini was moving around on the roof of her fourth floor house. She was encircling it aimlessly for the past two hours. Though accompanied by a little girl of age five, yet she was alone in her own world, retrospecting what went wrong in her relationship.

It had been around three months two weeks six days since her boyfriend left , hurling abuses at her. Till this day she hadn’t been able to come to terms with the reality. She had lost 5-6 kgs. Her cheerful lovely face showed no sign of happiness. One could apparently see the grief in her eyes.

Every now and then her little friend would intervene her, in her conversation with the past. She was reliving the past through the memories. Memories  which no more brought happiness on her face but drops of tears.

Ananya was continuously talking but  Nandini  paid no heed. She was asking God why it all happened. Why with her? When young she wanted to grow up. But never knew that growing up was about learning to suffer in pain.She was craving to be  a child who remains untouched from this word pain. A pain which was becoming unbearable.

All of sudden she heard a sound . She looked back and saw that Anaya had tumbled over a stone and her knee had got injured. Drops of blood were oozing out  from the scratched skin. She ran towards Ananya and helped her in getting up.  Anxiously Nandini  asked “ Is it paining a lot?”.

Ananya very calmly replied ,”Didi there is nothing to worry about. I’m fine. We grow up only after  getting knocked down”.

Nandini stood there wondering how this little girl said such words of wisdom so  innocently. Why the hell was she brooding so much? Life is not just walking on bed of roses but also confronting sharp curves. She brushed off the dust from Ananya’s knees . Nandini not only cleaned the child’s knee but also cleared her view.
