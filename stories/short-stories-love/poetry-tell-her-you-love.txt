[Tell Her… You Love Her…- Love Poem]

If you love someone… show it

 Let the other person know it..

 Don’t wait for her to find

 Maybe she never reads your mind!

Don’t just depend on your fate

 The “wait and wait” may make it too late !

 If towards her your mind is bent

 Say it ,coz later u might repent…

That why you didn’t say it when she was there

 Now she may be with someone somewhere..

That someone else could have been You

 If only you had the words you wanted to!

You never said it in the fear of rejection

 Maybe all this time she was ready for your affection…

If later you find she felt the same

 Then you would have no one but youself to blame…

You missed a chance you would have got…

 You lost someone… you loved a lot !
