Never did you tried nor did I

To express how I felt for you time to time

But if I find you now I might say these words to you 

Do listen to me , for it is just for you

Times when I see you are the times that I miss 

To feel like what I always wanted to feel 

Your black shiny hair and blush on the top 

Smile on your face and dimples by your cheeks 

Shine on the face and six fingers on your wrist 

Are the memories I have till I forget how to breathe 

Loud are my feelings though it never reach to you

But it’s just mine and will rest by my soul

If you ever see this you will know who am I 

The girl who always loved you and gave you shoulder when you cried 

The story will live ,I may not 

For the blink in your eyes 

I could see no more 

The thoughts you have 

I can hear no more 

Miles apart from me 

 what you left me for

Seasonal are flowers not my love 

Even if you come after years 

You will found me the same 

They say the love travel distance 

What if the destination is not known 

They say it takes time 

What if my watch is broke

Stories of love that i have heard before 

Are they only tales 

Or have any truth at all

Romeo and juliet never had a happy ending 

In my case it never had a beginning 

I met you in some place

I dont remember now 

But the depth of your voice 

Is like wow

It is a little different 

How it is happening 

For my love story 

Isnt about the queen or the king 

Neither it is the story of the princess

For their is no palace 

All i see is mess

Time i spend with you

I will always cherish 

Sweet as the berries 

Long as a hour

But remember they also say 

Love never fails 

What ever be the depth

It always sails

Thinks about you sometime

Dont cry any more

Memories you gave 

I dont want any more

Because love is not greed 

It comes to you whenever you need

I might not be any more

  But the love that I have will rest by soul  

–END–
