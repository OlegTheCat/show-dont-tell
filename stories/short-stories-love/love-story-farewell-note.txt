Love Story

Short Story – A FAREWELL NOTE

I was right when I gave too much importance to relationships. I always believed in life’s smallest joys because I believe they make up a big ocean of ecstasy. I loved moments of togetherness, fun, small fights, mockery, cute gestures of care and everything that made me feel I am a blessed human being. I always cherished beyond the most priceless treasure – my friends; people with whom I had no blood relation. I fought for them. Their slightest pain inflicted me. Their smallest success enthralled me. I don’t know if I think too much about such small notions that make life beautiful…but whatever happens I will always love my LYFFF with 

and 

 and what makes me do so unconditionally is another F-“FAITH” in HIM. It will never shatter until my breath stops…..

 

To You,

…..

There are times when we confuse ourselves on the narrow lines between friendship and love. Expectations and hope build up within us without our knowledge and we conjure a world between two where we believe all what we see is the truth. But then, when things don’t turn out the way you expected it to be, understand that it was not just supposed to happen. Believe in HIM, for His plan for you is always better than your plan for yourself.
