Some people have limitation even i had until someone entered and she said limitations are meant to be broken rather the same line was for rules as well.

It started with a simple chat and went for being an life time conversation. No issues where there untill you felt for her. Many people have such tricks to make girls fall for them but i had no intention. I was clear in it. And it was true. Making no mistake i made myself clear that i will not start. But due to some reason i told her about mine thoughts and she was amazed listening to them.

Someone said ” its meant to happen for a reason ”

 But then i realised it was just a normal talk and a no ending conversation . I would better frame it as a non bias conversation .

Dept was inside me and not in her words. Feel was in her words but i was offended. No normal thoughts running but its true that i don’t want to end this conversation.

It seems like a lot but a courtesy to handle the situation . And then asked me who are you?

 This simple question i couldn’t answer because if i would have answered it she must have gone.

A crazy innocent girl with little brains and normal facing was making the day. She was an inspiration to people who were upset and who has thanthopobia

 People like them are in world of fantasy but i met her in real life . Those are unpredictable but sincere . They just want to be happy in their life making others life cool and happy . She was someone rare, symbolized, and inspirational. They make efforts to extent but never are at wrong side.

Question still remains what if i want her for my life as a good companion and a good friend. There is no answer for such question but yes i want . I want rarely i managed to connect me with someone.

Its just been 6 days we are talking but i am connected to her .
