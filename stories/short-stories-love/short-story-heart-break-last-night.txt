Short Story Heart Break – The Last Night

That night when Jake opened the door he saw Grace standing at the door. She was pale and weak looking almost like a corpse. She was cold. Her eyes were tired and her lips dry. She was exhausted. She took a step forward.

“Don’t, ” he said breaking the silence.

“I’m sorry Jake. I didn’t mean to hurt you, ” she said in a tiny voice.

“Don’t. Don’t be sorry. You don’t deserve any forgiveness.” His voice firmed.

“Please,” she mumbled and broke into tears. She cried hard, like she never cried before. Her eyes bright with tears.

“I think you must leave. We’re done,” he was almost trembling with anger.

“You can’t let it end like this. We love each other.”

“It’s over,” he said out loud.

“No — please don’t end it like this way. I beg to you.”

“I love you Jake. I do — I really do,” her voice echoed in the tiny room.

 

His eyes rose to Grace’s.

He ached to told her that how much he cared for her and how badly he wanted to be with her but he couldn’t.

“Don’t you dare to say that you love me,” he said through clenched teeth. The words felt like ground glass in his throat.

She flew to him, hugging him tightly.

“I know you don’t mean all this,” she whispered.

He couldn’t resist himself from holding her but he pulled away from her. “Just go,” she shouted.

She was startled. She could hardly move. Her fingers felt icy. The words pounded in her ears as she started for the door.

“I hate you. I hate you so much. I wished I could have never met you,” she burst out, spinning towards him.

Turning quickly away, she ran for the door.

Then she was gone.

 

At that point perhaps he wished for the same. For several minutes he sat clutching his head on the floor and realized what he had done.

He could have forgive her.  He could have told her not to leave. He could have held her. He could have told her how much he loved her.

He’d probably never see her again.
