The depression was not ready to leave her. And the reason you ask? Well the many red pimples on her face were also being stubborn. And some of it caught on me too. No! Not the pimples but the gloomy mood. I tried to convince her, make up her mood through many ways, took her on romantic dates, bought her a huge teddy (she loves such stuffs), chocolates (which she declined to have saying they would make her condition worse) and many such things. Even hugs and kisses where not working. I was feeling terrible, clueless about how to bring back my cheery beloved. I thought, wondered deep and then suddenly I realized.

And so one fine day I took her to my room. I had blindfolded her. There after making the arrangements I whispered into her ears, ‘ when I exit the room you are allowed to remove the blindfolds, okay?’ I gave a peck on her forehead and left. She saw the light. There straight in front of her was the oval mirror. The room was lit yellow and she looked at her golden face being reflected into the mirror.

Many days have passed since then and believe me her smile and energy is more contagious then ever! That day back then I had realized that it was not me whom she needed, she needed herself, she had to rediscover herself. For her the mirror had turned into a window, a look into her inner self, which made her bravely question the self-deprecation, which made her realize that acceptance was the key to peace, she agreed to accept what she was or how she looked. The mirror made her believe in self and filled her up with a newfound confidence. In the end it was not about being lonely in there, it was about a time spent with self.
