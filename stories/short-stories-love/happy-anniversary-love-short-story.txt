She rechecked everything, cake ready – house clean – candles lit – decoration done. she wanted the arrangements to be perfect. It was their anniversary after all.

Usually husbands are said to be the ones who forget about the anniversaries, birthdays and all but it was contrary in her case. She was remembering how she forgot about their anniversary the last time, and how he managed to surprise her with all the arrangements and the gift. He wanted to make her happy , he wanted to make that day the most memorable day of her life. Indeed it was, for many reasons.

She took a deep breath and glanced at the clock right in front of her. It was 11:55. “5 minutes to go baby”- she said with a cheerful smile. She spend that time rearranging the wine glasses on the table, took out her I-phone 5 from the brown coloured limited edition Mochi bag and a picture that was beautifully framed. She typed a long Whatsapp message mentioning each and everything that she wanted to tell him but never did. She wrote about the time when they first met, their first date, how she fell in love with him the moment she saw him in the park. she thanked him for all that he has done . She thanked him for taking care of her, dealing so well with her mood swings , she thanked him for those ice creams at 1:00 am that he brought because she was suffering from severe tooth ache , for those 23 hundred roses that she found in her garden on 23rd November(her birthday).

As I said she mentioned each and everything and her heart ached all this time. She waited for another 3 seconds to send the message. It was 12 exact-23 march. She pressed the send button knowing that she won’t get a reply. “Happy anniversary love” she whispered and a tear drop fell on the picture that was beautifully framed. On the picture of her dead husband .
