One room, two cherubs, three words, and four eyes are hesitating to confer. Arjun and Madhu, a newly married couple are quite a bustle in scrolling their favorite social-networking site.

There is an ultimate reticence as both are off reserved nature. But deep inside, they are wishing the other one could cut the first turf. Countless tick-ticks were crossed just by staring and smiling at each other.

Do you need some water, finally Arjun confessed.

Yes please, she replied.

He reappeared with a water bottle and handed over to her. Madhu grabs the bottle gently, yet she is hesitating to peel the cover of her medicine. After few seconds of playing with the sheet, she threw it aside and again busy in her phone.

It’s time to take your medicine. Why are you adjourning it? Arjun questioned.

“Nah! I’m fine today”, she replied with a smiling face.

“Oh please, don’t need to pretense in front of me, Madhu. I know, you can’t sleep quietly without it.” He exfoliates the cover and insisted her to consume it. Still, she denied by nodding her head vertically. A hasty memoir flashed in her brain how she used to enact with her father. Whilst he chuckled at her childlike demeanor and again insisted her to intake it. As you infer, she refused again.

Huh! It’s enough Madhu, this would be the last time. Will you? Arjun questioned firmly. Though she doesn’t want to consume it but agreed by perceiving the ire look on Arjun’s phizog.

The moment she ingests the pill, Arjun handed over her ever favorite Gems which she endures after taking medicine from her childhood. Swiftly, they brought an ear to ear smile on her face.

She embarrassingly asked, “How do you know?”

I know you better than you do, he replied naturally.

Vividly, that’s what she craved for so long and finally feels appropriate to answer the question, “How did you fell in love with your spouse in an arranged marriage?”
