Second Life – Short Story Love

Hmm…today our talks again took a long time to finish.  Not a new thing although, as time passes soon when I feel him around me. Feel, its four letter word but has equally a deep meaning. It was not too long that I know him. It’s been around two years that I am in contact with a guy through some on line educational site. I, being a housewife of middle age, haven’t assumed our initial conversation to be too long.

Having a nice life with husband and kids, something was there in the life which was missing, something in behavioural part or something in feeling part, perhaps.  He was a college going guy who also used to take participation in the same website, the place where our conversation came into a new height. We started as a normal online friend, initially we used to share our professional life, our day to day professional work etc.

And meanwhile, in those talk I found a friend, which not only shares his life but also cares for me. This sharing and caring relationship that we both have in our life is something different. Since our knowledge domains are different and also we both belong to different age groups ,sex, family background it was never felt in our friendship. In spite of all these, a kind of different bond was there in our friendship.  It sounds something odd about the existence of such a fictional friend, to whom you haven’t seen or met, only shares your heart.
