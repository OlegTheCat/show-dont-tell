Romantic Short Story – One Night

Zayn once tried teaching J2EE Springs to me while going back home from office in our bus. 

He started, “what happens when you press a spring?“

I searched his eyes.

He looked at me expecting an answer.

I crossed my brows and stared at him.

Zayn widened his eyes, “Come on, tell me“, he said. “What happens when you sprinkle water on a tiger?“, he added.

“Tell, tell, tell“

“I’m not telling“

“Why“

“This is not what springs is about“

“This is what springs is about. When you press a spring, it comes back, isn’t that what a spring is ?“

The bus was pitch dark. We could hardly see each other‘s faces except when the bus whizzed past a halogen street light, his face illuminated.
