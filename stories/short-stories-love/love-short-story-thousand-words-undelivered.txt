 The room seemed a little deserted as it was dimly lit, shadows emphasizing the outline of a person sitting near a lit candle.The only thing visible of this person were his raven messy cropped hairs and his teal orbs. He had a paper in his fingers, the paper felt smooth and a little crumbled as the person rubbed his fingers on the last thing, that was touched by the person who was the owner of the paper.The paper would not be, able to be touched by its owner again…… never again. It was a mystery, whether the paper awaits its owner too as it felt damp within his fingers as if it is crying and wailing for its owner to return.The stark white paper contrasting against his pure black dress.

 He turned the envelope and saw an address……. The address to which he have to deliver the letter on behalf of its owner…….

 The final thing he have to do before he move out, he thought as he looked at the picture frame next to his chair.

 “You want me to do that,don’t ya……” he whispered to the picture frame.

 “Beep- Beep”

 I stopped typing in the computer and turned towards my cell phone, it read “1 new message”

 I thought for a few seconds whether to open the text or not,after debating with myself for a few seconds I decided to open it.

 I flipped open the cell phone.

 “Hey, am in town”- from kyre.

 “She is in town…… Just my luck.”,I sighed while massaging my throbbing temples. I ran a finger through my waist lengh brunet hair that was tied in a messy bun. I traced a finger under my puffy eyes, knowing that my sea blue orbs would be dim and gloomy.

 Kyre had been my closet friend from high school. She knew about everything that had happened and that’s happening in my life.From the moment she learned that I broke up with my former boyfriend/senior she tried her best to get me hang out with other people,so that I could forget him and move ahead in my life. Sometimes I tried forgetting about him, sometimes it felt like I could,but then I would realize that I couldn’t. I couldn’ t forget him. Am such a coward to move forward in life once again in life.

 I was lost in my reverie when I felt someone’s hands on my shoulder,shaking it.I turned my head in the direction and met a calm and composed face,his olive eyes looking intently at mine.His eyes were the only thing that broke his calm demeanour.

 “Hey Hirashi”, he spoke

 “Um ye-yes”, I stammered for a bit.

 His face inched his face closer to mine and asked,”Are you not feeling well? You look kind of pale.”.

 “I-I am fine. Sorry that I was spacing out a bit.”, I replied lowering my gaze,ashamed that some one cought me spacing out.

 “Hmmm its okay. Meet you in the presentation”, he spoke and went away.

 I looked towards his back until he disappered,I don’t get it how peoples around me were so happy despite the fact that I am suffering tremendously. Can’t they see how much am suffering.

 Some says eyes are the mirror to one’s soul then why can’t they see the pain and suffering in my tired eyes.

 Thinking that I returned back to my work.

 .

 .

 It was nearly 7.30 p.m in the evening when the presentation ended. I went to my seat,my colleagues started wishing me congratulations and then they started leaving the office building one by one.I was the one last to leave the building.The streets were covered with remnants of early snow indicating the up coming winter.The temperature had fallen down since yesterday.Due to winter the streets were a little deserted yet very gently lit. The streets lamps glow like the early sunlight not so harsh yet a little gentle. I started walking towards my apartment,unlike me everyone were happy to return home as they had someone waiting for their arrival. But for me the only companions I had were loneliness and suffering waiting for me.

 I was walking, suddenly my cell phone rang.I flipped it open.

 “hello”

 “Hey,Sakaki. Its me kyre”, the voice spoke.

 “Hey, where are you now?”, I felt my voice cracking.

 “…………..” there was silence from the other side of the receiver for some time and then I heard her sigh.

 “Still thinking about him?”, she asked.

 my silence gave her the answer.

 “How many times do I have to tell you to forget about him and just move on”, she seemed irritated.

 “I- I need to go. I will call you later”, I disconnected the call before she could hear my cries.

 I felt the tears ran down my cheeks, kyre thought forgetting him was easy. It is not,not for me. How can I forget him when he disappeared without a single clue in a fort night. I searched for him everywhere but couldn’t find him.

 “Wh-why…”, I mumbled while wiping my tears.

 suddenly I bumped into someone the impact was so strong that I fell backwards but before I could hit the road someone caught me.

 when I looked up, my eyes widened…. The same brown eyes…..similar sculptured face….. but instead of shining wine colored ruby orbs I was met with teal orbs, and instead of straight coal color cropped hair…. I saw messy raven hair.

 “Heiji…..” before I knew the words left my lips.

 At first I thought that I did something wrong but when I saw his eyes widen for a fraction of seconds I felt that he know something about Heiji too.

 “Are you Sakaki Hirashi?”, his voice was low, it seemed like he groaned instead of asking.

 In return I only nodded my head.

 “Meet me tomorrow near the central station.”, he spoke then he went away. I stood there like a statue, his words were playing in my mind like a broken recorder. I stood there watching him until he got mingled with the crowd.

 .

 .

 I couldn’t sleep that night,thinking about what he wants to tell me and more over how come he knew my name. And how come he resembles Heiji so much.

 The next day came quite quickly than I had imagined it.

 I was still in a daze when I entered the office room, while I was walking to my seat I heard my female colleagues whispering something about me.

 I knew they were gossiping about my dull nature.

 I was used to it by now,I was about to go towards my seat when,

 “I wish person like her would disappear”, someone whispered.

 I acted like it didn’t mattered, but it hurt a lot.

 I sat on my seat and started working, wishing that the day would end soon.

 .

 .

 .

 Finally the day arrived, that I had been anticipating from the beginning. I got up early and got dressed. Even though that strange person had asked me to meet him around 11 o’clock, but I couldn’t wait any longer and went to the station.

 I stood at the entrance waiting for him, searching for him among the crowd.

 It was a holiday so the station was crowed by passengers. The nearby shops were flooded with teens dating each others. Seeing them I remember my dates with Heiji, we used to have so much fun.

 I began fidgeting thinking that he bailed out on me.

 The moment I was about to go back, some one roughly grabbed my arm and forcefully turned me backwards. I collided with a strong yet steady chest and felt someone’s warm breath on my forehead.

 I lifted my head and saw Heiji’s smiling face.

 “Woman, why are you here so early”, someone’s steady voice broke my reverie.

 when my vision cleared I saw it was not Heiji, it was that same strange person who had called me to meet him.

 “Any way lets sit somewhere”, he told and started dragging me towards a cafe. We sat at the cafe.

 While he was dragging me I saw many girls ogling him but he never gave them a second glace.

 “Thank god I still remember your habit of turning up early”, he spoke softly, his face devoid of any emotion yet his soft voice betraying his calm facade.

 “Wait how come you knew about my habit”, I asked without any hesitation.

 He gave an audible sigh and without saying anything searched for something in his pocket.

 I saw him taking some kind of paper out.

 I was about to tear it open, when I felt his hands grab my fingers lightly.

 “Before you open it I want to say something…..”, he spoke more softly than before.

 I couldn’t pin point it but I felt like something bad is about to happen, yet I sat there without moving like I was spell bound with his words.

 “I resemble Heiji because we were twins”, he spoke.

 my mind was in a haze I couldn’t get what he was telling but the only thing that my mind remembered was “were”….

 “What does he mean by were”, I started asking myself again and again.

 He sensed my inner conflicts, as he emphasized his words,

 “Yes we were”.

 “Every thing I know about you, had been told to me by Heiji. He described you so vividly that I remember each and every detail of you”, he trailed “you might have wandered numerous times the reason of Heiji’s disappearance, where and why he vanished 3 yrs ago”.

 In return I only nodded my head.

 “The truth is 3 years ago, he got selected in a course that was to be held in Italy”, he spoke softly.

 Yes I knew that he got selected, but I didn’t knew weather he wanted to go or not.

 “He never wanted to leave you behind. He couldn’t bring himself to do that. So he decided not to go, but in order to cancel his name he went to Italy.

 So 3 years ago he went to Italy, but…..”

 My mind was screaming not to hear anything further, I knew what will come.

 “But his plane crashed”, he nearly whispered.

 I didn’t knew when my tears started streaming down, when he got up to leave.

 Now I knew where he vanished 3 years ago…….

 .

 .

 I didn’t knew what time of the day it was. I didn’t knew how many hours I had been crying.

 I remember calling my work place and taking a day off.

 I still lay on my bed wide awake, looking at the ceiling and crying. I turned towards the small table and saw the letter.

 I remember him saying that this letter will help me…… but how. I was back in my room, sitting on my bed, holding his last and first letter. Heiji’s letter.

 I looked at the letter.I touched it slowly .I ran my fingers on his writings……It made feel like I was touching his fingers.I wiped away my tears and tore the envelope. The paper was damp and little crumbled, careless as usual,

 “It was so like him” , I chuckled.

 I wiped some more tears and started reading it.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I read the letter again and again.Taking each and every word written by him.Touching the letters again and again as I felt his presence through his words.

 .

 .

 .I wiped my tears fully adamant on not crying anymore.

 “How can I cry, when Heiji wants me to smile”, I murmured to myself. I went to the small balcony and opened the sliding doors.

 I stepped outside the door; the wind was cold as snow had started falling. The wind was cold and yet it warmed my dying heart giving it another hope to go on living.

 With great difficulty my lips twitched upwards forming a small yet precious smile, a smile for Heiji. The street lights started turning off as the sunlight broke through the horizon. The darkness of the sky disappearing slowly as the light started engulfing it. The darkness from my heart also started melting too.

 I felt warm as if Heiji was hugging for the final time. I decided to move ahead and change myself little by little as I whispered “I love you too”, for Heiji to listen.

 As morning came I got ready for my work. While I was arranging the letter, I found a card. It belonged to that twin brother. I took the card and put it in my pocket. I reached my work place and greeted everyone with a smile. Everyone was shocked as well as happy for me.

 After finishing my work,I went to the address written on the card. I stood at the door anticipating. Suddenly the door opened. It was him.

 “So you came again”, his voice was soft and then again he searched his pockets. ”For this I think”, he spoke while giving me a gold ring on which both Heiji’s and my name was engraved.

 I felt happy, such happy that I don’t remember when I had felt it last.

 “Anyway good to know that you are smiling again”, he spoke as I saw him giving me a smile.

 I took his hands and tightly grasped it, “Thank you very much. You had helped me a lot”, I told while holding his hands. For a fraction of second I saw some different expressions in his eyes. His face softened as he hugged me tightly. He whispered something but I couldn’t hear it.

 “My name is Natsume Tachibana, remember that”, he cockily replied while smirking.

 “Yes Natsume – kun”, I replied as I bowed down and took my leave.

 My new life started unfolding, while I took each step with our everlasting love and courage to face any kind of challenge.

 As she touched my hands to thank me…..

 I felt something strange, something warm coursed through my body that I hadn’t felt after both my parents and Heiji death. The strange emotion evident in my eyes, I knew from her expression. Before I knew what I was doing, I hugged her tightly

 “Sorry , Heiji ….but I had fallen for her”, I whispered while hugging her.

 When I released her, I was relieved that she couldn’t hear me.

 “My name is Natsume Tachibana”, I replied cockily with a smirk.

 “Remember it cause I won’t let you forget me for a long time”, I whispered to myself more than to her.

 “Yes Natsume –kun “, she replied and then bowed down and took her leave. Her ocean eyes sparkling with life no longer dull.

 As she walked into her life, I stood there watching her knee length brown hair flow freely in the wind. I stood there watching her until she got mingled with the crowd.

 Somewhere I felt Heiji smiling at us; he finally got the long awaited peace. He got his peace as he finally set us both free. Free from all the sadness and loneliness.

 “Now I can leave this dam crappy place”, I spoke loudly while smirking and kicking one of through random furniture that was bought by Heiji.

 The day started as every normal days, as I woke up. Then I went to my wash room and got ready for my work. After getting ready I went to my work place. I engaged myself in my normal routine.

 “Ne Hiraishi san would you like to go shopping with us?”, one of the my colleagues asked.

 I turned towards my colleagues with a smile.

 “Yes, I will go”, I replied smiling.

 .

 We were wandering on the streets after shopping, chattering and laughing freely.

 “Ne Hiraishi san….. it seems like you changed a lot”, one of my colleagues commented.

 “Yes…. It seems to me too.”, I replied.

 We were walking when some one passed me, I couldn’t see his face properly but I cought a glimpse of raven shoulder length hair……. For a fraction of second I felt like it was Natsume, I dropped the thought. When I turned back there was no one, yet I felt like I was right…….

 “Is something wrong?”, one of my colleagues asked.

 “Nothing”, I replied.

 “Then lets go and grab lunch”, she replied.

 “Yes lets go”, I replied.

 Every one started walking towards a nearby restaurant.

 “Welcome back, Natsume-kun”, I whispered as I turned back to leave.

 Suddenly my phone rang and it was kyre.

 “Kyre”, I spoke into the receiver, “lets meet someday”

 “Yes”, she replied from the other end of the receiver.

 I made my way the towards the restaurant talking with my friend happily.

 .

 .

 A person having shoulder length hair suddenly stopped in his tracks,

 “Hey Natsume…. What happened?”, his friends asked

 In return he just smiled…….”it seems likes you were unable to forget me”, he whispered with a smirk.

 “Nothing….. just found something I had been searching for”, he replied while catching up with his friends.

 Unable to understand what he meant they went towards their destination.
