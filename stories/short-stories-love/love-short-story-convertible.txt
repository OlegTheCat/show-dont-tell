Love Short Story – Convertible

“It is a white convertible this time; she is staring at him from behind an 80 years-old wooden door. He is searching for her very vehemently. The fact that his eyes are looking for her at every corner of this lively street, elates her heart in a known manner.

Suddenly, her familiar purlieu started to dance friskily, to his song. He was dancing with her peers as they were throwing themselves towards him. His rugged looks were the first thing which has made her weak down in her knees, ever since high school. Voluptuous beings who were dancing in front of him didn’t suffice what his eyes were looking for. It’s her he wants and that is the reason he is in this curvy little village, singing among strangers. He has always admired her curves, very often thinking to himself, that no one will ever have it better than her in more than a zillion century to come.

And when they were encompassed by their thoughts; and swiftly came the climax of the song. She couldn’t help but want to release him from his ordeal of not seeing her. Hiding her face behind a black mask, she went to him and started dancing with him. He recognized that familiar whiff of her; gently removed the mask from her perturbed face. And both stood there with the song playing like a jingle in the background. It is her favourite sight in the whole world, his rugged face. And for him, he is finally home, as he is looking at her.”

And with that thought her heart allowed her brain to wake her up, as it was enough oxygen for their owner to get through this week.

She woke up, hair all frizzy, and she remembers now; her dream sequence was a favourite pop video of Lucky Ali’s song “Tere mere saath jo hota hain”. This kind of song sequential dreams knock her subconscious mind whenever she is not talking with him.
