This is one of those stories where love does not win, this is story of  simple sweet girl who falls in love with the boy she never imagined. To start the proceedings her name is YASHITA.

It was a rusty day ,all he felt was dejected and defeated,the only purpose for him to prepare for exams was his father ,no matter how hard he tried he never felt like studying or understanding anything.He reached his tuition ,there were a lot of people or to say in other words a small crowd down there looking at the INDIA MATCH which was going on against Australia .India were in deep down trouble but Sachin’s innings of 175 lit a hope in  lot of fans.He looked at it for one last time and went upstairs.

As soon as he reached there ,he saw his friends playing cricket with a ball made of paper and a pad which took place of the bat.As his friend hit the paper ball it came with full force onto him,he took the catch of paper ball with one hand ,and gave an expression as if  he had stopped a bullet coming for an AK-47.Tarun told him”nice catch Mr.Raj”.He gave a faint smile. Everyone heard sound from stairs and got themselves seated in the chairs and acted as if they were solving problems

As the teacher came in , there entered an other girl along with her. She was pretty tall for her age with black beautiful eyes radiating her beauty , her long hair were disturbing her and she tucked them back slowly in a smooth motion.The dimple on her chin gave her a cute touch,she was quite fair compared to other girls of tuition .She gave an impression as if she was one of those girls who competed in MISS INDIA contest. He could not return his gaze from her until he was interrupted by his friend ,who wanted him to give way to go out as he had some pretty urgency to run to washroom.

Ma’am asked her to introduce herself.She said in sweet soft voice “MY NAME IS YASHITA”.He could not think of anything else that night except the name that echoed in his sleep YASHITA.
