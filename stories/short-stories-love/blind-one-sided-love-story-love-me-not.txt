Blind, One Sided Love Story – Love Me Not

Image © Anand Vishnu Prakash, YourStoryClub.com

Plucking the petals of a Daisy flower I said alternatively ‘He loves me’ and ‘He loves me not’. I had many thoughts revolving in my head along with that. I was wondering whether true love exists in this world?

Years back I met the so called love of my life. We were happy staying together. We spent hours together and probably there was a time when we would become afraid when we couldn’t see each other for a second.

But as it is said, things are bound to be changed. Soon we were separated due to job and we moved to different cities. I thought I still loved him so did he said.

Years rolled by and I started to realize he has made a best friend who is a girl. They enjoyed spending time together. I was not at all suspicious because I had trusted the person for so long. But soon he started to prioritize her. In an era of long distance relationship, phone calls and social networking sites become life. Soon he started to withdraw himself from all these things. Whenever I called him, I could only find him enjoying with her so called best friend. These days I try to stay away from his happy life.

I remember those days when I used to blindly follow whatever he told. I used to help him like a mad person. But he didn’t seem to care about me. He always used to stay busy and sometimes abruptly told that he wants me out of his life.

While writing this story I can only pray to god that the heading ‘Loves me not’ soon becomes ‘loves me’ and my faith in love restores again.
