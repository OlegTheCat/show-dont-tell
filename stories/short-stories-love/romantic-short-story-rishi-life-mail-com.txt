You calm me down as if like the blazing sun renounces and hide behind the lofty green meadows every evening. And as the rippling reflection of the sun from the lake gradually perishes and the tranquilizing breeze catches its flow, the gentle caressing by your tender, little puffy palm makes my eyelashes to bow down. The long fluffy strand of your hair grazes over my face sporadically with the fluttering wind like a brush of a painter moving over a canvas. I dive into a slumber being oblivion of the relentless call of the earthly affairs. Away from the commotion, away from the excruciating agony of life, I find myself at bliss in the feathery cradle of your arms.

 The sun has return to its abode behind the meadows; the gleaming reflection from the lake has disappeared. The soothing breeze started to gain its momentum. I called him up thrice by now. But there was no response. My heart was pounding hastily, legs were quivering, and palms became numb. I ran back hard. My eyes were blurred with tears. I somehow typed the password to log in to Rishi’s mail. A new item was saved in the drafts. The subject read “my angel”.
