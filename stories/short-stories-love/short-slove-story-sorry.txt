The audiences, especially college students, were present in that annual function of university. And I had been invited as the special guest and the mike was in my hand to encourage them about writing. During my speech a student asked for a romantic incident. And the whole hall desired same and started shouting “sir please, it must be our memorable moment. Sir please, sir…” and hooting too. I understood that they would not be silent until I say yes. I had filled my face with smile and agreed by saying “O.K.”

1: This is one of the best moments. So here a short description….….

“When I was at her home and trying to ignore her because she decided that we should have broken up. I was angry at her because how can she decide alone.

 She came into that room where I’m studying.

She: What makes you come here?

 I: My exam is going to held in this city.

 She: really?

 I: oh, you feel I’m lying.

I know that she has doubt because I had come over there to meet her on her birthday and I lied to everyone.

 I took my Admit Card out of the bag and showed it to her.

She: oh, ok.

 And again I have made me busy in my study to show her that I do not care if she is or not.

 Suddenly, she came near to me and hold my face with her soft hand and moved softly towards the left and left a trail of love on my right cheek. Obviously I was shocked and my heart beat in now on race when she kissed.

She: ‘sorry’.”

The whole hall was filled with applause and showing their standing ovations to me.

I: Life has different aspects but everyone has its own importance. There must be some memorable moments as love, happiness, sorrow and beautiful fights too. They all will have been in life of yours. Enjoy it. Bye.

And left the stage for others to create their own memory.
