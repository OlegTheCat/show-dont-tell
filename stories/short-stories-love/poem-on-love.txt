 from 

O’Love you are so magical

 Nobody knows when you enter into heart

 Nobody knows how your feeling flows

 Nobody knows how deep your love

O’Love you are so magical

 You make everything impossible possible

 You reach the extreme top and down

 you can make one alive and dead

O’Love you are so magical

 You are invisible but one can feel you

 You are joyous one can understand you

 you are wonderful one can follow you

O’Love you are so magical

 You are the king you are the maid

 None can judge your status

 You can remove the barriers and

 you can build the wall

O’Love you are so magical

 how you act and how you play no-one knows

 how you begin and how you end everyone knows

O’Love you are so magical

 please love,love me so much

 please love,leave me alone

O’Love you are so magical

 You make one cry

 you make one laugh

 you play magics in all life

 you play musics in all love

O’Love you are so magical

 you make one’s face look tedious

 you make one’s face look gorgeous

 you fulfill life with meaningful experience

 you kill the life with meaningless reason

O’Love you are so magical

 you make one sacrifice everything

 you make one gain nothing

 you be far&near or hide&seek

 still this heart follow you

O’Love you are so magical

 you make one’s mind go block

 you make one’s heart beat fast

 you take away the eyes contact

 you take away the lips movement

 still this heart need companion of your’s

O’Love you are so magical

 nothing left to say

 nothing more to say

 but need place in your heart

 So that i can place my heart in it

O’Love you are so magical

 you left me and i left u

 still the lonely begins in heart

 no reason no ways no meaning

 Still this life wait for suspense

O’Love you are so magical

 O’Love you are so magical

 O’Love you are so magical
