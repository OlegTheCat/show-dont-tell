 from 

It was the time of autumn. A boy of nearly 13 years of age named John fall in love with a girl Agnes. They both study in same school. John has two friends- Alvin and Andrew. Agnes also has two friends- Alex, Abbie. John’s parents were Alden and Aileen. Agnes’s parents were, Alston and Abigail.

At the first day of school, John and his friends were in Canteen. As soon Agnes and her friends came there. They sat on the seat next to John’s seat. John saw the girl and fallen in love.

In the class fortunately John’s seat was next to Agnes. By the time passes they started slowly – slowly talking with each other. John told his friends Alvin and Andrew about his love. Alvin said to talk to her about. But Andrew said, “Please wait for a right time. Now try your best to go closer of her heart”.

John invited her in his home. And in his home proposed her but she refused. John remains standing there with a shock and mouth open. Agnes left from there. But John remains to impress her.

Agnes friends Alex and Abbie were conversing that Agnes loves John (it means that even Agnes loves John and she told her friends too) then also she refuses his proposal. Why she did that?

I’ll tell you. She did that because she does not trust John.

Then a twist came in the story, Shuffling. That means that their sections had changed. In another section a girl named Annie fall in love with John. But as john loves Agnes, he refused her proposal.

As soon Agnes came to know that, she came to John and accepted his proposal.

As they were at the age of 28 they marry.
