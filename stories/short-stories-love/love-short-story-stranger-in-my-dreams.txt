Love Short Story – Stranger In My Dreams

As I walk through the trees I can smell the oak leaves. The grass is wet from last nights rain. The sun has yet to rise but I know what’s around me. I’ve been in these woods so much that I could go blind and still find my way home.

I live in an old cabin about a mile away from where I stand. The trees grow tall, towering over me. Although I’m alone, I feel protected. I feel as if someones with me, watching my every move. But the safe feeling suddenly disappears when I hear a stick break behind me. The sun is just coming up so I can make out the figure of a man. I’ve never seen anyone else in these woods before.

My heart speeds up as he begins to walk toward me. I can’t move because I’m in shock. He inches his way closer to me. Even though he is a few feet away, I still can’t make out any features. I do know that he is tall and muscular. He stops about a foot away from me. My heart beating so fast, I manage to spit out “Who are you?”

The man doesn’t answer me, he just stares at me. I can feel his deep stare, tearing into me. He quickly pulls me to him and holds me in his arms. He moves so fast that I had no time to think, so I just stand there with him holding me. I can feel his heart beat, beating faster than mine. Suddenly he leans in to kiss me. Right before my lips touch his, I wake up. I’ve had this dream every night this week.

Who is he and what does he want with me? Why is he in my dreams? I wonder this for so long.
