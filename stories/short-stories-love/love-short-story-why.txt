While time didn’t seem all that important, reason did. I don’t bawl over the fact that he came back after 

long, dreary years

but a 

 lingers. 

did he leave me in the first place? And 

 did he come back?

I still remember those long nights I used to cry myself to sleep. Those long hours I used to sit in front of his porch, wondering what was it that I did, that made him leave so suddenly. But again and again, my questions were answered with another question-

One day, I was with him, laughing and teasing and at last fighting. And the next day, he was gone. And after twelve years he appeared again, without an explanation so as to 

 he left. He came to look at me one last time.

I wasn’t with that reply. For twelve years I’d been trying-real hard-to forget him. And now, when I was starting to, he comes again to break me.

“One last time? What the hell does that mean?” I asked, obviously angry. And instead of answering me, he took me in his arms, like all those times before, and kissed me several times, until we both were panting for breath.

It was our last kiss.

“Don’t ever forget me”, he said. And then, vanished suddenly, before I could even breathe.

He left without an explanation.

Without one last look.

With ‘

 in mind, I started off to find him. It took me awhile before I could find his abode.

But ‘awhile’ was apparently too long.

Death played his toll on him. But even then, he looked perfect, just like he always did. His sharp features I could identify any and everywhere, remained the same.

Cancer, they say, was the cause.

Whatever it was, my questions still remain forever unanswered.

A ‘

 still lingers.
