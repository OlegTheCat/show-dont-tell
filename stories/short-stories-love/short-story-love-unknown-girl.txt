Short Story of The Unknown Girl

In my early days of college , i used to go to my college via bus and auto-rickshaw. So probably mid august, i was waiting for the an auto. But most of autos and taxi were not running that day because of some strike. It was around 9:15 AM, suddenly a girl came on Activa, she had covered her whole face with a cloth except eyes and hands with skin color gloves.

“Are you going to DCRUST college ?”(yes that’s the name of my college ) She asked me in her sweet voice.

“yeah!” I replied shockingly.

“You have to ride this Activa to come with me” She retorted with a smile. (Yes i can tell you if a girl is smiling by just seeing her eyes)

I agreed and jumped on her Activa. I pressed the ‘self start’ button and it started. Then she put her hand on my shoulder before sitting on the Activa. She was having legs on both side of Activa. Her knees were touching my thighs during the ride. I avoided brakes so that she should not think of me as a jerk. After reaching the college gate, i stopped the Activa.

 “Take it to the parking.” She lovingly whispered in my left ear from behind. I again started the Activa and parked it in college parking. She again touched my shoulder to get off from Activa. We didn’t utter a single word during the whole ride.

I thanked her while giving her Activa key. She didn’t reply but again smiled. I tried to look at Activa’s number plate but she was looking at me so I turned back and walked to my the block of my classroom.

Its been 3 months now, I still don’t know that girl, all I remember is ”her beautiful eyes” and to search that girl, now I badly stare into eyes of each girl of college.
