Sad Love Story – If I Die Today..!!

It would be so much easier if I died today. No more fights no more abuses. No more ego clashes no more attitude problems. If I die today I don’t have to cry tomorrow.

They said love was beautiful. They said love was magic. All I know is love is pain. No one has a fairy tale love story or is it just me.

I am not the only one he bothers about. I am not the only one that matters. Rather he matters to himself the most. His love is not unconditional. But does he feel the same about me? But I gave him my everything..EVERYTHING..my soul my heart my body..EVERYTHING. Was that not enough? Well sometimes everything is not enough.

Five years…five long years have passed. Never i saw that love in his eyes which i expected. Does it happen only in movies? Is this never real..??..ever..??..for anyone..?? His love is not selfless. His love is not unconditional. It has too many restrictions. The rules are different for us. He is free. I am not.

Does no one has a perfect love story.? Do I expect way too much or does he fail to give me what i expect? Have i raised my expectations a lot or he doesn’t want to fulfill my expectations.

He never loved me like I did. Though he was the one who proposed this relation five years back. Does he even love me? Does he even know what love is? He says he loves me. Then why don’t i see?

I cry myself to sleep every night. I am more happy alone. Because I cry when i see him..when i talk to him. I like the loneliness.. But i can’t leave him. He says he will die..though I am sure he can survive without me. But can I? Maybe.. I am alone anyway.

But if I die today it would be so much easier. Because if I die today I don’t have to cry tomorrow….
