So, he calls up. He knows he should call and he does. He subconsciously let’s his fingers dance around the bright blue screen, while all that’s running in his mind is…

‘OKAY! I AM CALLING HER.’

Everything’s fine. Everything’s going great until the sweetest voice in the world goes ‘Hie!’ from the other end of the line and he runs out of words. This conversation is so important to him that ideas, thoughts, opinions, scenarios, their iterations and reiterations  gush into his brain from all the sides and they choke him up. He gulps his rum and as the glass clears, so does his mind. “Hello!” again goes the voice from the other end.

“It’s been a long time since i have heard your voice. “

// Yeah! It indeed has been. Where were you all these days? //

“Don’t tell anyone but I was getting trained by the league of shadows. They kind of kicked me out though. Low attendance. ”

//HAHA! You never learn to give a straight answer.Do you? //

“Where’s the fun in that? “

//You realize that this is exactly the reason why you can’t keep  up a  conversation with anyone beyond 5 min. Right? //

“Hmm. Point made. But hey, not with you. We always used to talk for hours. Discussing our favorite movies. Razzie worthy performances. It used to be fun.”

// Yeah!! Used to. What happened to us man? We grew too old? //

“Well i don’t know about you but I am still in my sweet sixteens. I just bought myself a YOLO hat bro”

“Haha! I am beginning to miss you man.”

“Well, let’s meet then. Go watch a movie or something. You can bring your husband too if you want.”

//I would love to but I am not married yet. Thank god.//

“Oh. Nice.”

//You sound relieved. Watup?//

“ha ha. You wish. I was just thinking about the last time we watched a movie together.”

// Ya. It was some stupid romantic flick. //

“What? You hated that movie?”

// Ya. Sorry. I didn’t let you know. I was a polite kid back then. I hate these type of movies man. Movies which are basically terrible attempts to  unrealistically beautify  things. Which try  to show  that life is all balloons and flowers. //

“Man! I am sorry. If i knew how much you hate romantic movies i wouldn’t have taken to one. I just googled which movie should i watch today and the first result was that movie.”

//Ha ha! That’s ok. I enjoyed going out with you though until we ran into that friend of yours.//

“Oh yeah that stupid. He was not my friend. Just a stupid guy. I was trying to get rid of him but he wouldn’t take a hint. Basically spent the whole dinner with us. As**ole.”

//Yeah right and  he wouldn’t quit until he figured out if we are dating. If yes, since when?//

“Yeah! As**ole. ”

//I don’t get why we find that stupid urge to label everything, to categorize, sub-categorize, trying to convince ourselves that somehow we have found a pattern to life. May be we are afraid to accept the fact that life is not a laid up track, a story line to comfortably move up on but a chaotic concoction of infinite variables, baffingly random yet beautiful. Afraid to accept that life is pointless. So we create fake reasons to live, like moksha, love, forcing people to push themselves into categories they don’t fit in. Trying to bind themselves with commitments, pre defined by generations before them. Trying to be ‘friends’ ‘lovers’ ‘husband and wife’. You can’t just define love as a single kind of relationship right. Human relationships, they are on an infinite spectrum of emotions. You can’t just label them. May be that’s why they say, true love is hard to find because the truth is  TRUE LOVE DOESN’T EXIST.//

 

And now he remembered the answer to the question //What happened to us?// He bailed. He realized what he was getting himself into and he bailed. He walked away from her asphyxiating his heart saving it from much more pain. The pain of breathing love.

//So, what do you think? Am I being a nihilistic bitch or Am I right?//

 

Meanwhile someplace above the clouds, a guy with a cute bow and arrow  was smiling at them,  “Ahh! There’s nothing more fun  proving humans wrong.”
