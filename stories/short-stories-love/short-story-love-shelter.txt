Love Short Story – The Shelter!

 from 

We recently shifted to our new flat,house is full of relatives. I generally avoid social gathering, this time I am in big trap. I am searching for a space at my own place. All were discussing about my marriage, what they will wear,how step by step things need to be done, same discussion is going on for last 3 months! God,save me! I was restricted to go outside, it was going difficult day by day. I like giving space to others and same I expect for myself.

My phone was on flight mode,battery was dead! He tried called me twice?  where to go ??washroom is the safe place to talk now! Called him 2 times.

“Can we talk now?I don’t know why I am feeling irritated instead of getting excited,day after tomorrow is the main ritual,Rohit is super excited but why can’t I be?

I am missing you today, it’s not that everyday I think of you but this unwanted feeling is pure very pure, till date. Your intentions were cleared from the beginning but sometimes we really can’t fight with our mirror, that law of attraction is never-ending. I know your commitment and responsibility towards your family you can’t compromise on that part! Don’t you think sometime we should stop the battle of fixing the broken mirror? Things would’ve been much better, we would have sharing the same shelter.

Our destination is now washroom or isolated place, this is not what we wanted from us. Ok bye now, I have to rush, I don’t know when we can talk again. Wish me a happy married life. Say hi to your son!!”

Yes mom, 5 minutes !
