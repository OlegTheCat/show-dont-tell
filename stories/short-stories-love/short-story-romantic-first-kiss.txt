The gloom is never so agitated, no such hush in the ambiance of the long stretched road, with the serenity of her proximity, Arjun the shyest guy couldn’t make a step further to interlock his fingers with her. God, why it is arduous for me, he thought.

Madhu’s nebulous eyes were like two beryl-green jewels melted snow which makes Arjun fall in love with her, again and again, and her enchanting smile can make him obliterate about everything. Hesitantly he rose his hand towards her waist but the blush on her cheeks gave it all away. The chasm between them was the line of modesty and by enclosing the flaps, the arc of her belly Arjun was utterly lost as staring at Madhu is his beloved habit. Her dulcet voice is as sweet as any songbird, the sculptor could not have fashioned her seraph’s ears and pixie’s nose any better, he thought. Certainly, he wants to hug her and again the Arjun couldn’t make a move. Here, the most clever Madhu inferred his intention by his demeanor, slowly turned towards him with a most innocent face. But Arjun got hold of her white t-shirt which says ‘BE PATIENT. ‘ He was like God, what the..hell is this.

Eventually, he attained the grit to hug her. The moment his fingers touched her shirt, she had a huge hormonal imbalance which made her faint. Her jawbone met his shoulders and he took it as an approval. Naturally, he leaned forward, his head along with hers resting on his shoulders, hands draping around her waist and then his lips crushed against hers for which her heart was yearning since ages. Every touch of his systematized him to kiss even more passionately. Their lips were stuck together till they went breathless. Gasping for air, she saw him get up and turn the other way like nothing happened. Madhu, as her habit burst out the happy tears. Ultimately, she drafted this as the most cherished moment in her dairy.
