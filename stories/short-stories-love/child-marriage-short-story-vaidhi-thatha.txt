Love Short Story – Vaidhi thatha!!!

As she sat in the midst of old ripped-off cardboard boxes and trashed moth-smelling books, her eyes fell on a pretty old small hand book. It did not look like a hand book. It had the looks of a diary. ‘Someone’s personal diary’, she thought. The curiosity of a girl can take her to places and Arundathi was no exception. She grabbed the book as if it were the best seller of the year and was lying in the street with no one making a claim for it. She flipped through the pages and inside it she saw the ugliest handwriting she had ever seen. If there was something Dhiti (lets call her like that from now on…) valued the most in her, it was her handwriting. She had won many prizes for it in school. The last one she got was when she was in her 12th standard back in school. She always felt that only handwriting speaks more of a person than appearances. Luckily both her mom and dad had pretty decent handwritings and had escaped from her reprobation.

Now seeing the handwriting in that ragged book, she was indecisive as to read it or not. There were two things stopping her from reading the book. One the handwriting and another, the guilt of ‘reading someone’s personal jottings’. As she was thinking, she accidentally came across the year in the diary. It was a pre-independence diary dated 1933. This increased her urge to read the book.
