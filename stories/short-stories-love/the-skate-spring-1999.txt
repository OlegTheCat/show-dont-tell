The Skate Spring

The skaters dominate the youth culture now. To be a part of it you must be able to skate with a skateboard, and I’m barely good enough to do that, to be part of the group of friends to whom I belong. I’m not just worse than the rest, but also less brave, skaters aren’t very much spending time at home. After school, we often go to the great skate ramp close enough, there comes skaters who lives far from there as well. There we can hang out, skate, play skate music.

It’s more fun snowboarding, then I don’t care at all that I’m less great or not as brave. The one who is second worst of us is a girl, Caroline. I am afraid of Caroline, really afraid of her when it’s dark outside and she sends text messages too quickly, no one can text that fast. She must be something supernatural.

Last night I was with Caroline at her place, we were in her living room. She looked at me a few times, I aksed her if she believed in the paranormal and she didn’t know. Sometimes she thinks that weird things happens but she don’t know for sure. I had also experience weird thing, as if a demon was there or something.

We decided to turn off the TV and try to communicate with a demon, if there was a demon there. Caroline asked:

“If there is a demon here, please let us know.”

Then right away we knew, it was there, no doubt in our minds. Caroline asked, why are you here? I answered her:

“Because you asked me.”

Caroline asked: “So, you are a demon?”

I answered: “Yes.”

Caroline asked: “For sure? How could you even know?”

I answered: “Because I am a demon, a demon is wise.”
