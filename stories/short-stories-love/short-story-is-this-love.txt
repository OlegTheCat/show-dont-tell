I was hurried and it was the need of the time, because it was the question of life of my best friend ‘Derek’. He was going to marry a girl who had relationship with an other man. My friend was a very good human being. He helped others and loved everyone by heart. A man like him shouldn’t be cheated.

I had only an hour, after this I could do nothing. They would be husband and wife then, so I was riding fast. My summer holidays had already spoiled. It wasn’t important to attend my friend’s marriage, so I was enjoying my summers with my beautiful wife ‘Lucia’. She is the best woman in this world. I always feel peace with her. These holidays were the best holidays of my life.

One day, When I show her the photograph my best friend’s bride, she was shocked.

She said, “I have seen this girl with an other man.”

This news couldn’t be given on phone, so I decided to come back to ‘London’. My friend’s life was more important than my summers. Fortunately, I reached the church in time. I called my friend and took him to a lonely place.

My friend said, “What happened?”

I told him everything.

Derek laughed and said, “My dear friend she don’t have the relationship with only one man, she has the relationship with many other men. But I don’t mind it, because I love her and I want to see her happy. If she enjoys it, then she will do it and no one can stop her. It’s her life and she can do whatever she want. My love will never dis crease for her, so now just enjoy the party.”

I couldn’t say anything and went to my car. I just said to myself, “Is this love?”
