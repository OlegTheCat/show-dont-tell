Life is sometimes so imaginary…. When i look back 6 years from now tears roll down from my eyes …. this is just tears

not a story but a piece of pain in my heart.

31 st night 2008, i still remember that was the first time i was going to  a party  with my friends .. i was in my very tender age of sweet 16… all excited about the first night out allowed ..

When i reached the venue it was such an amazing feeling, i never felt like this before suddenly my eyes struck on someone who was staring at me. He was  cute,fair n tall handsome guy… my eyes just stuck on him,  i never felt like this before i fell for him without even knowing anything about him ….

Days passed but with each passing day i kept imagining more and more and then one fine day i was standing by my window when i saw him passing through the lane …. there was no limit to my excitement, i was all on my bed jumping and dancing….though he had not noticed me … Then everyday i started standing by my window n one fine day he looked up and i hid behind the curtain .. this started happening nearly everyday.

And one fine day he shouted “can we be friends”and all i did was just blushed …..

That day we became friends exchanged numbers …. Few days later when we were officially going to meet up for coffee, i was all ready to go when i reached there, to my surprise someone was sitting with him already …he introduced me then “hey meet  my girlfriend …..

i was all shattered i dint know what to do … without telling him anything i just moved away, he kept calling but i just didn’t listen anything……. I was so hurt…

I felt like a fool that day… I wept for so many nights i did not speaking to him after that day till today… but on every 31st night i miss those eyes staring at me…..
