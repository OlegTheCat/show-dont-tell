..HOW LIFE CHANGED..

“See.. Whatever happens. We will not let anyone destroy our friendship. It will remain for ages till we die and our children will be the best friends like us. It will be a circle. Eternal and infinite.. ”

She texted him. He read it and sat for a long time looking through each and every words in that text.  He felt the warm tears running through the corner of his cheeks.  He was disturbed into senses by her another text..  “Are you there? “.

“yes.. ” He replied

“promise me that you won’t leave me alone in my life.. ” she asked

“I promise you Swetha. I will never leave you. But life won’t be the same as you think… ” he texted

“No. Life is what we make it. Sridhar,  I know you won’t leave me…. ” She typed. Suddenly she received a call. She ended the texting and answered it.

“Anirudh. Wake up.. It’s time for school… ” he said.

“Papa– It’s sheethal ‘s b’day today.  I want to buy a gift.. ” the little boy rolled in his blanket.

“OK… We will buy it for her.. ” he said.  As Anirudh woke up and went to brush his teeth. His wife came over to the room.  He smiled at her.  She combed her long hair with a brush and he hugged her from her back.  She smiled.  “Sorry I couldn’t keep that promise.. ” he said in a made in sad tone.

“What promise..?? ” she asked.

“Our old promise of making our children the best friends. And making the circle eternal.. ” he said and smiled.

She smiled at him.  “But you kept the promise of being with me together in my life… And we are still the best of best friends.. “she said.  He hugged her tight.  Their bond of hug broke when Anirudh’s little smile came to the room.  He closed his eyes tight.  They laughed. “Life will never be the same Swetha. ” he said to her and she smiled.

“Life will never be the same Swetha.. ” he said with the tears running out of his big old glasses.  His eyes were aged and lack vision.  Everything seemed to be blurred like past, but it was as beautiful as his past to see her smile in that photo which was kept clean for the past 40 years in his cupboard.

“Mr Sridhar…. You have a visitor.. ” the warden said. He wiped the tears from his eyes and went to the visitors room. He saw Anirudh and his wife who looked very angry like someone had pulled her to visit him. He smiled.

“Daddy are you fine? ” he asked with a fake concern.  “Yes.. ” he said with a fake happiness.  Then a little boy of five came dashing on the door and looked at him, and then at Anirudh.  He seemed to identify the old man.  He let out a gasp.

“Daddy, This man was dead right? We have his photo framed in our old home.. ” he said in his childish voice.

Anirudh was not shocked by his son’s words. He remained quiet.  The old man took his walking stick and balanced himself onto the ground.  He stood up, and went slowly to his room. He took her photo. But this time, his eyes didn’t watered.  He smiled at her.  “I am sorry Sridhar.. Life is never the same.. ” he heard her voice.

The statement was justified and the cemetery was ready for him. “Sir…. ” a voice came.  A boy of eighteen came running with a photo in his hand. “Keep it with him…. It’s only his property.. ” he said.  The photo smiled at his lifeless chest. Life always changes.
