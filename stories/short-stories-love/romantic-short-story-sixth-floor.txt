Leena checked her watch. 

She got up and swiped her card. She took the elevator. 

 The doors opened at the 6th floor but no one got in. Just when she thought the doors would close, she sees a hand waving towards her. She holds the door and he gets in.

” Thank you. I thought I had to wait for a few more minutes.” Abhinav said looking at her. 

” No problem. Someone pressed the button at your floor actually. That’s why it stopped. ” She replied. 

“Oh ” he said and looked away. 

Awkward silence followed. They both got off at the parking lot and drove away.

Abhinav was driving towards the convenience store. He had to get some stuff. He saw a grey sedan parked there.

Few seconds later, he was walking towards the same store. He was wheeling his cart around the aisle 6 when he found her talking to an old lady.

” Haha. I know Mrs. Akthar. Kabir is great kid. Lot of fun. ” She was saying to her. A 5 year old kid came from behind the old lady and put something in her cart. ” Thank you Kabir” She beamed at him.

Then their eyes met. Leena looked at Abhinav with apprehension.

She looked away. Abhinav was still looking at her. 

He thought

Abhinav was searching for something. He was pushing his cart along. 

He then ran into the ” Mrs. Akthar” she was talking to. ” Son, could you give me way please? ” she said. ” I am so sorry ma’am. I didn’t know I was in the way.” He smiled apologetically. 

He was about to turn around another aisle when he could feel someone clutching his arm tightly. He looked around and saw Mrs. Akthar having a seizure. Her face went pale and her palms were twisted. Her eyes looked lifeless. He immediately shouted for help and took her head into his lap. Leena came in an instant.

” Oh my God. Is she okay? ” She said shaking Mrs. Akthar.

” We need to get her to the hospital. Now.” Abhinav was shouting now. ” I will drive her there. Take the kid, will you?  He looks freaked out. ” He said to Leena.

” But the ambulance is coming right? Should be here any minute. ” She said to Abhinav.

“We can’t wait that long. Lets go. Or you can stay.  I am getting her out of here now. ” He said. Leena looked confused. ” I don’t know what your name is but trust me on this. I will get her safely. ” Abhinav said.

” Lets go. Here let me help you. ” She said taking the other arm of the old lady. ” Kabir , please stay close. Its going to be fine. Grandma needs a doctor. ” She said patting the kid’s back.

Leena and Kabir were sitting side by side. Leena was stroking his hair trying to calm him down. She saw Abhinav walk towards them. She sprang up and walked to him.

” Is she alright? ” Leena asked him.

” Healthy as a horse. You guys can go see her.” Abhinav smiled taking Kabir’s hand.

” Buddy, Grandma is a little tired. She is going to be alright though. No worries. ” He said bending down to Kabir’s height.

Kabir gave him a wide toothed grin.

Mrs. Akthar was thanking both Leena and Abhinav profusely. ” Anyone would’ve done the same. I am glad you are okay. ” He said holding her hand.

” I have to excuse myself. My mom will be waiting. Was good meeting you Mrs. Akthar. ” He said getting up to walk away.

” Son, please drop Leena on the way. Its getting dark. And she left her car near the store.” Mrs. Akthar was saying to him. 

” Um.. Mrs. Akthar, I want to stay. I will go later. I don’t want to leave you guys alone.” Leena said.

” He called my son. He will be here in 2 mins. Nothing to worry Leena. Go with him. ” She replied.

” You don’t mind right? ” Leena asked Abhinav. 

” Not in the least. Please. ” He said smiling at him getting all poetic. 

They said their goodbyes to Kabir and Mrs Akthar and got into his car.

After a few minute of awkward silence Abhinav spoke. ” So you know her well? ” He asked carefully not looking at her directly. 

” Um.. we meet at Kabir’s school sometimes. My niece studies with him. ” She said softly looking at him. 

” Do you mind if I put some music on? I can’t drive otherwise. ” He asked politely. 

“Its your car. ” She shrugged smiling at him. Abhinav laughed. 

 She thought. 

The music started playing and Leena looked up at him. She instantly recognized the familiar notes.

Abhinav looked at her. ” Er.. should I change it? I mean I know its kind of weird. A lot of people don’t understand why I like it.” He said stretching his hand to stop the music.

” No no. I love Lindsey Stirling. She’s amazing. ”  She said trying to wave her hand as if to stop him. 

The tips of their fingers touched. He immediately apologized. ” I am sorry. I didn’t mean to.” 

She blushed and looked away. 

” So what’s your favorite? ” He asked trying to make her talk.

” Crystallize. I like her collabs with the Piano guys too.” She replied still not looking at him.” What’s yours? ” She asked looking out at the traffic.

” Elements is my favorite. Crystallize isn’t that bad too. ” He said smilingly. ” She’s awesome anyway. Great talent. ” He said still looking at her to say something.

” I know. ” She replied. 

” I wish she had a concert here. ” She said looking at him again. 

” That’d be so cool. I’d be like ” Lindsey, TAKE ALL MY MONEY. ” ” He laughed.

She laughed too. ” I’d probably give her everything I own myself. ” She said.

He parked the car and looked at her. 

” Thanks. Nice meeting you. ” She said while opening the door. 

” No problem. Have a nice evening Leena. ” He said still looking at her as if she was the first of her kind. 

He didn’t drive away immediately. He was still smiling remembering every moment with Leena. 

He heard a knock on the passenger door. His heart raced.

Abhinav opened the door and found her beautiful eyes looking at him. ” Leena. ” He almost shouted. 

” Um… Hi. I just wanted to… I just… ” She was trying to get her words together. 

” Did you forget something? Do you need anything? ” He asked. 

” Thanks for everything. What you did in there was great. ” She said. 

” No problem Leena. ” He laughed. ” Don’t be so formal. I thought we are friends now. ” 

” I didn’t get your name? I am sorry, I don’t know why I didn’t ask you before. ” She asked him.

” Oh I am sorry. Its Abhinav. I work in the same office by the way. ” He said stretching his hand out to shake with hers.

” Nice to meet you Abhinav. I guess I’ll see you at the office then? ” She asked surprised at her own candidness. 

” Sure. Hold that elevator for me.” He laughed. She laughed too.

That elevator did stop at sixth floor every time Leena got in. For a long long time to come.
