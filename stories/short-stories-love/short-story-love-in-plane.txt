The beauty of love can’t be explained in words. It can only be felt. Smita was a magazine writer and Sudhir was the editor of the same magazine. They met in a conference of the magazine for the first time. For Smita it was a love at first sight. Sudhir was married with a American beauty. Her name is Ela.

For the sake of work they have to travel together. They use to publish their magazine in many parts of world. Smita knows all about Sudhir’s family. She wanted to control over her love ,attraction , and affection for Sudhir but she always failed. She wanted to confess her love but can’t. She wrote her love in the face of a story.

Sudhir was very thankful to Smita as she wrote the beautiful love story. The story plotted the real characters Sudhir, Smita and Ela as Suresh, Sudha and Eyana. She beautifully described her love for Sudhir in it. The magazine was published in America and the story appreciated all over the world .

They finally finishing all work they were ready to take off. But their flight was late by two hours. They were in waiting room. Smita was reading her story. ” It was a sunny day when Sudha met Suresh………the tragedy was that she can’t confess. And once their aeroplane crashed while traveling.” That’s the end.

Oh! what I wrote. Seeing her expressions Sudhir asked what happened. Sudha just can’t end her love for Sudhir in that tragedy she said. Ooo you wrote that story he said. Yes i wrote but i don’t want Sudha to have that tragic end she replied. Ok ok we will make its part two he said. Start getting the part two in your mind “

” She suddenly said I am not Sudha.

It was announced that the flight was ready to take off. They both attended the announcement. They were sat near to each other. Suddenly Smita decided to confess her love. She wanted to go infront of him. And a sudden movement happened in the plane. Ohh what happened she asked. Sudhir replied nothing dude. We are just getting closer.

The plane crashed !
