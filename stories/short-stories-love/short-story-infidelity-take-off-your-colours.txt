Short Story Infidelity – Take Off Your Colours

Short Story Infidelity – Take Off Your Colours

I banged the typewriter keys, harder each time. Making the monotonous noise to mask the one in my mind. The voices in my head, the ones speaking the harsh truth.

He was a liar.

And somewhere in my mind, I knew it.

I sat silent in my bedroom, the typewriter making all the noise. I imagined the figure of him on the bed, with his lovers all over. The lights out and left behind the promises of life. Every thud of my typewriting bringing the end near.

It wasn’t long before it became all too obvious. The beginning was where I should’ve stopped him. The usual smell of alcohol and the smell of perfume from his coats. Still early. Then came the late night calls and sneaking into the bathroom. And then the whispers and business trips way too often. Too late.

His eyes never met mine, the talks at the dinner table too awkward and the love never enough. Every time I looked at him, I wondered if he’d open up and say. But, no. He’d just go behind my back and live the nights, guilt-free while I waited with dinner at home, and my fingers crossed.

Soon, I heard the door open and close, with his dimensionless voice saying “I’m home.”

“Welcome, dear,” I answered without looking at him.

He didn’t even bother to come closer like before and so I didn’t care to ask about dinner. But today, the dessert was special. And he was going to get a whole lot of it.

Beneath my beloved typewriter was a compartment holding my weapon. It was brand new and loaded. My beautiful black gun, just waiting to claim blood.

I stood at the door, staring at my unfaithful lover.

“What are you looking at, honey?” He asked, the lies speaking clear from his ever-pleasing eyes.

“Nothing, just got you something,” I answered and that was the end of us.
