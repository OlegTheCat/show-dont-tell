Sweet Short Love Story – First Encounter

The song reminds me of the first look you gave!! I remember it was third week of August (remembering exact dates still remain a mystery for men). Waiting for you outside an eatery was like something I hated but it all went by when I saw you for the first time. Gosh! You looked lovely, charming, mesmerizing blah blah. So will it be a lucky day for the person who was still in search of his lady love was the first thought that bowled me over.

The charm and elegance you carried with your persona is something you have not lost till date and I know you will carry the same in near future. After all the basic formalities we were introduced (more in a formal way). The next big question that played around my mind was, does she speak?

You had no qualms of the way you jumped on the ordered food of which I was later told that you were clearly instructed for not touching the food! You made my heart skip a beat when you uttered your name and it was the second time I saw you open your mouth; first was when you were busy gobbling down the delicious food.

I was feeling embarrassed sitting in front of someone who was more interested in eating than in me! I wished I should just push all the food lying on the table into your mouth. Pizza for the first time was playing a perfect villain in my life.

Finally the pizza chapter came to an abrupt end when your mom in hurry escorted you down to the parking area. But there was some relief, your smile made my day. All the time spent looking at you when you were busy with that big scary pizza made some sense now.

And that was it everything was finalized and we tied the knot exactly after five long months.

Note: so many exclamatory signs means I was in total confused state the way I still am!

Clouds may vanish

Colors may fade

But my love for you will never see the end.
