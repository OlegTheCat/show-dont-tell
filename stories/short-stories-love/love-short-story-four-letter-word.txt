A wave of dust spread through the air.

 Joshua coughed but carried on, determined.

 He had woken up that morning, promising himself that he would clean up the filthy attic.

 Rose had asked him to.

 It was her first request when they had decided to move in together.

Joshua thought back to that moment from over a year ago, and smiled to himself as he wiped his sweaty forehead with the back of his hand, his fingers grubby with dirt.

 Sitting on a carton, he picked up a rusty old iron box and opened it, sighing to himself.

 He had been at this for over two hours now and while he did manage to achieve a lot, he also had so much more work left.

 His legs were cramped and his throat, dry.

 But he knew that if he got up now, he’d never get back to it.

 So, he carried on.

The first thing that caught his fancy in the box was a photo of Rose when she was younger.

 “She must have been five” he murmured to himself.

 In the photograph, Rose was wearing a long, pale green frock that came down to her toes. Her shoulder length hair was tied up in two ponytails, each secured with a bright green ribbon.

 But what attracted him to that photo was the naughty look in her eyes, her mouth wide in laughter, her chubby fingers curled into fists to contain her excitement.

 He wondered curiously what had happened in the moment before the photograph was taken.

 Wishing he had been there to witness it, he put the photo is his pocket, vowing to ask Rose once she got home from the Day Care Centre.

 Picking up a pile of letters that lay at the bottom of the box, all of them securely tied up in twine, Joshua stared at them, guessing that they were love letters.

 He knew it was bad manners to pry, but he also knew that he and Rose had nothing to hide. So, he cut the wire and opened the first letter.

Joshua stared at the letter in anger. He couldn’t believe the stupidity of it.

 Rose’s voice was beautiful.

 He remembered how he had fallen for her voice before he had even looked at her. If it weren’t for her shy karaoke singing in the bar that night, they wouldn’t be together now.

 Muttering curses, he opened the next one.

 

Joshua resisted the urge to hunt this boy down and kill him.

 He couldn’t understand how a girl like Rose could even fall for him.

 Rose, with her sweet vulnerability and tender heart, being taken for granted by this fool made Joshua very angry.

 He chuckled at the memory of her glasses coming in the way when he had first tried to kiss her.

 ‘Don’t take them off’ He had told her when she started apologizing, as he had framed her face in his hands, loving what he was looking at.

 Had he been as shallow as Ben was when he himself was in college?

 

 Joshua’s own heart constricted at the thought of Rose going through that much pain.

 He remembered, in agony, how she had looked doubtful when he first told her that he loved her with all his heart. Back then, he had thought she didn’t love him.

 Now he realized that she had just been scared.

 He would tell her, once she got home, that he’d never tire of her.

 He would make it clear to her that even every single night with her for the rest of their lives would not be enough.

 The last letter lay in his hands and Joshua realized that he dreaded reading it.

 But he also wanted to because with every letter he read, his love for Rose strengthened.

 

Joshua wondered why she had kept these letters when they were filled with wonderful things about her that were portrayed in a bad way.

 Rose had the most gorgeous, wavy brown hair that shone like copper in the sunlight, as far as he was concerned.

 

, he thought, shaking his head.

 He realized that she had changed over the years, wearing contact lenses and trying not to be emotionally dependent.

 He loved her selflessness and how she thought about everybody else, trying to brighten up others’ lives. He was glad to be a part of it, a part of her life.

 The little reminders of her that she added to his house, like the round wall mirror and the tiny showcase pieces helped him acknowledge her presence and cherish it.

 These men were all wrong about her.

 Joshua folded the letters and put them back in the box where they belonged.

 Willing the anger to leave his soul, he realized that if it weren’t for these pathetic excuses of men, he’d never have gotten Rose.

 For that, he was thankful to them.

 At a distance, he heard the faint sound of the doorbell.

 Smiling to himself, he got up and descended the ladder, leaving the cleaning of the rest of the attic for later.

 He was going to take Rose out for dinner tonight.

 Rose, with her lovely brown hair and cute spectacles.

 Rose, the love of his life.

 The carefully picked diamond ring lay in his pocket, waiting, as he made his way to the beginning of an exciting new journey called Love.
