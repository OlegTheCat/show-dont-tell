Short Love Story – Once

They said he moved on. They said he found someone else. Someone better than me .To be honest, I never believed it.

It didn’t last long. Not even a second. My happiness.

He wasn’t alone.

Next to him sat a girl about whom everybody talked about. I was paralysed  I saw his arms around that girl. Their eyes stuck into each other’s and after a while their lips too. It pained a lot to think that girl was me once. I was his special once. I was his world. ONCE. It didn’t work out.

Before they could see me eavesdropping, I immediately turned around and hid behind the wall .I closed my eyes tight to stop my eyes from rain but they didn’t seem to listen. I bent down and reached the door so that they wouldn’t see me. No one could ever understand how it wounded me when I said “they” instead of “Us”.
