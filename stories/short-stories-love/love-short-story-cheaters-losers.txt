It was a lovely chill morning. I went out for a walk. The cool breeze blew, the sound of the birds, the pleasant climate, i loved it. I pulled my phone and called Megna for a walk too, who was my friend form the school day.

I loved her very much. but never said that to her. I thought it was the brilliant moment to express it out. I slowly went near here but my mind told DO NOT DO THAT OUR FRIENDSHIP WILL BE LOST. I din’t care my mind.

I asked “Hey Megna do you have belief on love??????”.

Megna jumped into a laughter and replied “Why this question? Absolutely yes…..”.

“Then can you say something?” i said.

“Yeah dude”, she replied.

“I LOVE YOU” i said and extended a bouquet.

She said “Wow  i was waiting for this word for the past six months but anyway you expressed it now”.

‘Wow!! Its hard to understand any girl’ went a marquee in my mind. “you mean?”

Megna “yes i love you tooo” she screamed… I could not believe.

Then our daily phone duration went nearly an hour. We went out daily to enjoy our love life. And one day her brother saw both of us in a mall. Our entire communication lost. I tried to call her but his brother picked up the phone “Hey who the hell are you man?” he asked.

I Hung the phone immediately.  I could not even find her anywhere.

 

AFTER SEVEN YEARS:

I got married due to my parent’s compulsion. One day Anand sent me a mail, i opened and checked it

I went to the marriage, where i saw Megna. My heart skip a beat. She was still unmarried and still loved me. I was really surprised and in confusion. Tears came out of my eyes. I was so selfish and a cheater. I was filled with sadness.  I realized that nothing can stand before a true love. And am the loser who miss a great, sweet, and a true loving girl in my life.
