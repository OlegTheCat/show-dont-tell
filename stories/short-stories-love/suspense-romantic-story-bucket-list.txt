They’d met exactly a month ago. And on this anniversary, Mark had taken her to the most popular French restaurant. He’d brought her a red dress earlier that evening – a flaming silk with open shoulders and ample cleavage- for the occasion. The usual signs had followed. Red roses… limousine… expensive restaurant… exotic wine… close dance… tonight was the night!

Kristen Miller smiled a happy smile. She’d been waiting too long for this. The limousine arrived to take her back. As they approached his apartment, she grew more nervous. He hadn’t asked her during the dance or later during supper. And now they were heading back. 

 She asked herself.

At the door, he asked her to close her eyes. “It’s a surprise”, he said.

She did so, and they entered the living room. She dug into her purse and her fingers curled around the metal.

“Now open your eyes,” he whispered at her ear.

They were standing in the living room. Amid a faint aroma of lavender and little scented candles that lit a trail to the bed which was neatly done and adorned with rose petals.

He lowered himself to his knees and held out a ring.

“Kirsten Miller, will you do me the honor of becoming Mrs. Kristen Colett?”

Her fingers were still touching the metal.

She blushed, and then nodded.

He smiled happily. She squeezed the trigger and heard the familiar muffled sound. His eyes had widened and a red blotch appeared near his bow tie.

“I’m sorry, love,” she whispered. She felt the guilt, but it disappeared, replaced by a feeling of satisfaction, of a mission completed. Her Dark Passenger was sated… for now.

Wiping a tear from her cheek, she fished her phone from the purse and tapped her manicured finger on the icon labeled 

 

The screen lit up and displayed a numbered list:

 

#21. Steal a dress- check.

#22. Screw best friend’s boyfriend- check.

#23. Find and kill true love… check!
