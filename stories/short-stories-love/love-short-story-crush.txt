Love Short Story – Crush

© Anand Vishnu Prakash, YourStoryClub.com

Who would have thought from saying you were the cutest made me fall in love. It all started on stage and now we are back on stage, only a few more times though. After the letter i gave you from Christmas was thrown away, after you running away like a coward on Valentine’s Day and now all this. You act like an angel but when your with no one, just me and you, you’re so different. Now today i am getting closer to you and your friends and you try to stray. Even i was going to kiss you a few days ago. I decided not to because i probably would have had bad things happen.

“You know right now i just wanna do something to you, do you know what that is?”

“Severely hurt me.”

“No….no..”

“Minorly injure me.”

“No…i’d never hurt you…I would never hurt you…never…do you want me to show you what i want to do?”

“Okay..”

“Really?”

“Yeah…”

“Okay then. But please don’t hurt me after, okay?”

“Uh….then i change my mind…”

 

More happened but my attitude changed from the hatred i tell everyone to the love that i show and how much i’ve changed.

 

In years, because he hates me when he regrets those times he wants back i’ll say, “You had your chance..”

 

More things happen and now i don’t know what to do. I get mocked by your one friend…

“Shorty…” (his friend is short)

“Bossy…or Alex lover/person that likes Alex…”

“I don’t like Alex!” This ain’t true as you can tell.

 

And now on May 15th i have told your other dear friend about my feelings toward you well at least that i like you.

 

Now also being mocked for the things i put on social media and now i have done many things that you won’t find anymore or however you did before.

 

Even if you hate me, i still love you….

 

Please comment below telling me advice (or questions).

 

Thanks so much!!!
