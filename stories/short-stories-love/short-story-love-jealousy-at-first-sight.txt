I was 16 young and cold hearted on the outside but deep down like all other teenage girls even i wished to be loved. It was a sunday evening ,exams were over so I was desperately waiting to vist my favourite place: a place where I often went in search of peace.

The love comics on the wall,the small wodden coffee tables, the cute littel bean bags ,the soft music, the light coloured walls, the humble staff and the sweet aroma of coffee were the only things i could think about. When I reached i was astonished to see a horde waiting outside the cafe..My anxiousness made me jump from the bike and interrogate the manager about the situation, luckily it was nothing but a powercut…

I had no choice other than waiting and cursing myself for coming alone. I soon started frisking around..And there i saw a guy arriving on his bike wearing red tshirt and black tracks, with a gym bag on his shoulders, tall, fair and handsome..I was bewitched by his charm. No sooner did i notice a girl from the crowd calling his name and walking towards him. The smile on his face made it very obvious that it was none other than his girlfriend…

Seeing them together made me feel low, waiting there any longer was next to impossible so i just drove back home. He was a complete stranger,i knew nothing about him,but then too seeing him with a girl made me feel like i had pit in my stomach…All of sudden i had lost my appetite and getting sleep was even harder..And there it was the brain and the heart clash…My brain stopped me as he was with someone but my heart wanted to talk to him, to get to know him..

There were lot of questions going on inside me but the question which kept me awake for several nights was-“Was it Jealousy or Love at first sight?”
