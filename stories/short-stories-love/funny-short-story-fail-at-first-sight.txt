Have you ever had a date before? Do you have any experience in dating? Actually dating is a fresh thing to teenagers because as we become mature, we begin to develop an interest to the opposite sex. Dating and be dated symbolize that we are no longer kids and we are getting to be teenagers. I would like to share my experience of my first date. It is not a wonderful experience. Instead it went terribly wrong and till now I still have a bad memory when recalling it.

My first date happened in a quiet day of autumn. I asked my classmate, Sandy, who sat next to me in class, to go out for lunch. She is quite charming with long curly black hair and big brown eyes that everybody paid attention to her. I thought I was fortunate enough to have successfully asked her out. We proposed to go to a 5-star seafood restaurant to have a big meal. The day before our first date, I thought of what to wear and how I should look. I felt both nervous and excited.

Finally that day came. We met at the entrance of the restaurant. To my surprise, Sandy had a large crowd with her. They were my classmates. Sandy told me she had asked them to have lunch together and chatted and had fun. I felt embarrassed and disappointed instantly. I was formally dressed with suit and tie, all of famous brands.

While they, including Sandy, were dressed casually, I looked obviously strange. The others looked at me at a distinctive way and I just wanted to find a hole burrowing into the ground! But Sandy seemed to be unnoticed. Eventually, we all went to a fast-food shop for lunch and had a good time to chat.

Looking back, I thought Sandy intended to back me off by asking her friends out in such an indirect way. I would never ask her out for a second time and I would remind myself to be careful if I have another date.
