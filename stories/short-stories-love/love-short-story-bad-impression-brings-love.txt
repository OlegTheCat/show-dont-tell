The last exam was about to begin, being together in the class will be nearing its end.  Alex was happy that she did not reject his proposal, at the same time he was day dreaming how joyous he would have been if Eva accepted . Alex was back to reality when assessment papers were given.Not caring about the score, Alex was enjoying all the expressions that Eva’s face expressed.

The day ended at school and all left to home. That night Alex received a call from his friend saying that he will be getting a good news within two days. Next day when Alex went to school he was in a very excited state. Wanted badly to know what was the good news at-least a hint, but unfortunately his friend was absent on that day. The pleasant surprise came to him on that eve itself

Door opened to heaven

 A text message “Hi” came to Alex from an unknown number, he casually replied . After a delay of 2-3 mins the reply came “this is Eva”. Alex was in cloud nine after seeing his and desperately wanted to talk to her. But Eva asked him to call her next day early morning 4 o clock. That night  he felt as if there was no one happier than him in this world.

Cool December morning

 It was 4 in the morning, Alex  opened the door quietly  and went to terrace. It was a cold December morning. He dialed Eva’s number when  the word “Hello” came from other side his feet was not in the ground, he had many words to speak but he could not utter a single word.

Good boy Alex

 Alas he spoke out and asked her what made her to accept his love. Eva said it was the bad impression that William created in her mind about Alex. She was very curious to know is really Alex that bad. That curiosity made Eva to think about Alex, and when she found the bad expression created by William about Alex was false. She eventually fell in Love with him.

“Bad impression do bring Love”
