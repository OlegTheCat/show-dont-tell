On a sunny evening, suddenly thick black clouds covered the evening sky and there was a quick downpour which soon stopped and there appeared two pots of golds – two rainbows at a time. Covering the hills and the waterfalls, admiring this stood Bubble the handsome Labrador and princess the pony.

The two decided to walk up the hill to have a better view of the Rainbow. After they both climbed up the hill they were admiring the rainbow and Princess said, from here the plains down look marvelous and Bubble said, “How true!”

Princess asked Bubble shall we walk down back to the plains? Yes, we shall and it is getting darker, we need to get back home. Puffing and panting they both got back to the plains and the next day, when the sun had risen they met one another at their usual meeting place and were viewing the hills and waterfalls and said, when we stand and look at the waterfalls and the hills from here they look beautiful and it is indeed scenic exclaimed Bubble.

Princess said, when we climb up the hill the plains look beautiful, don’t they?

Rio the beautiful parrot flew and sat on Princess and asked them what were they admiring so much?

Bubble and Princess together said they , “From this end we are admiring the hills and the waterfalls and when we climb and look down, we enjoy the scenic beauty of the plains, so lost in our thoughts admiring the beauty on either side, wish we could live simultaneously on both the sides.”

Rio said, “the grass always looks greener on the other side, when we stand there the grass this side will look greener, so be happy where you are and enjoy the beautiful blessings you have received and be happy, contented and thankful with what God has blessed”

and flew Rio, leaving Bubble and Princess to think.
