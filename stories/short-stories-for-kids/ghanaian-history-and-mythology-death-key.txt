Death Key – Ghanaian History and Mythology

Far back in the 17th century when hunting and gathering was at its prime and fetish priests (seers) were fiercely feared because they were regarded as  messengers of the gods; across mighty oceans, through thick forest, across desolate desert and deep within the valleys of Mountain Afadjato lied the great tribe of the Asantes, the Asante Empire. Mere mention of their name sends shivers down the spines of others. They were feared because of their bravery and persistence and were therefore referred to as Asante Kotoko (porcupine warriors – if you kill thousand, thousand more will come).

The Asantes were ruled by King Obiri Yeboah I. He was a brave man who showed determination even at the face of death. He  had a beautiful sister who was fancied by almost all the men in the empire. Manu as she was called, had a problem with childbearing. Manu remained childless for a long  time and was referred to as obonyini (infertile). To avoid disgrace to her brother the king, Manu decided to ran away to a small town called Akwamu. She packed her things and during the night, tip toed out of the palace to set out. After walking about 50 kilometres through the dark and thick forest, she was feeling hungry and therefore decided to pick some wild fruits for food. Since it was dark, She picked ‘Akee’ (a poisonous fruit) and fell down unconscious. She regained her consciousness only to see herself been fed a concoction on the thigh of a hairy man. She stood up ready to ran but fell down again because she was so weak. The man explained that he was picking herbs in the forest when the gods guided him to her. He urged Manu not to give up in life because for him to be directed by the gods means  she has an important role to play in the future. The man therefore admonished her to go back to her hometown when she regains her strength. Manu told the man why she ran away and why she can’t go. The man made some incantations, cast sedee (shells) and told Manu that she will give birth  so she should go back home. Manu became very happy and thanked the man. When she regained her strength, she stayed there for another three days. She got to know that the man was a recently removed  priest by name Tutu Aban and a very good friend of her brother King Obiri Yeboah.

When Manu returned home, she was not surprised when she heard a search party has been organised for the four days of her mysterius disappearance. Few months after returning, she gave birth to boy and named him Osei Tutu. Since the Asantes inherit property matrimonially, Osei Tutu was the likely successor of the king. In the mid 16th century, the asantes were engaged in a fierce fight at Suntreso  with the Damans in a battle  described as ‘Dromaa War’. In the heat of this battle, all the important chiefs who were fighting for the king Obiri Yeboah were routed, and the king sustained a fatal injury. Obiri Yeboah’s son Sabin was the only one who struggled to stand by his wounded father, the king. Sabin was given a title out of recognition of filial piety demonstrated. Therefore,the palace was divided into two-those who want Osei Tutu to be ruler and those who want Sabin. To avoid future conflict Osei Tutu was sent to the king of Denkyira as a shield bearer.

At the Denkyira palace, Osei Tutu fell in love with the Denkyira king’s sister and impregnated her. He fled out of fear for his life to a small land called Benyin. As he was roaming about in the land looking for food and shelter, he was captured and sent to their high priest as he was new in the town. When they learnt that he was a royal of the great Ashanti empire, they gave him food and shelter as they feared any maltreatment could spell doom for their entire tribe. As he stayed there, he got closer to the high priest Okomfo Anokye. Okomfo Anokye told Osei Tutu that he is destined  to unite all the tribes. Just as they were chatting, a Benyin spy entered and whispered to Okomfo Anokye. Okomfo Anokye  told Osei Tutu that his cousin, Sabin who was about to be be enthroned (as king Obiri Yeboah has died of old age) has been killed in a war. Osei Tutu wept bitterly and decided to return and asked Okomfo Anokye to come with him as his advisor. Okomfo Anokye agreed and they both set out to Asante Empire.
