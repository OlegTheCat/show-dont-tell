The biggest problem that we see in a startup or any organization is the anxiety of doing too many things at once or worrying about the next problem rather than the immediate one.

When Bhishma was supposed to be killed in the Mahabharata war, Krishna neither worries nor gives the sense to the people around him on Dhronacharya being a bigger threat.

His focus is on the immediate problem but when the time comes he does have a plan .The character of the leader or the startup team is highly critical here.The composure they show in times of adverse situation or when they see themselves in a No Man’s land.

Many startups’ we see around us are “One Product Wonders”. Reason is they are either too much short term goal oriented or too much worried about the future or scaling up and delaying the necessary decision making process of having a broader and deeper technology vision

It’s always that right moments of taking those critical decision transforms a startup into a direction towards success.

During the slaying of Jayadhrata, a warrior on the side of Suyodhana (Name of Duryodhana is Suyodhana)  ,there is an  eclipse that occurs and Arjuna keeps his bow down. It is at this moment that Krishna observes that there is an opportunity and urges Arjuna to take up his bow and arrow to slay Jayadhrata.

In Startups also the key to success is impeccable attention to detail and grabbing of opportunity when others see it as an impediment .This is  exhibited by Krishna in various times during the epic war.

We will look at other different and fascinating aspects of learnings that we can imbibe from Indian Epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana in the next write-up.
