Its a small story about a rain drop which teaches us a moral value too…

Once… as the summer started ending and rainy started, god was continuously busy in making rain… so one of the whole, named bindu started wondering … after starting my journey from sky where shall he’ll put me in!!!

As it was now bindu’s turn to drop off from the sky to the ground, god noticed bindu’s confusion. and asked “what is it dear ? why your’t ready to leave?”

bindu said ” i don’t know exactly where to go…!”

Then god smiled and said ” come here my child, your journey is in your own hands dear! but all i can do is just guide you that it! let me help you here…you can see a beautiful ocean down there isn’t it?? and far far down you can also see the dry land which is almost died! and sown seed is waiting for you already !! do you know that?? ”

bindu – ” waiting for me!!! why would it wait for me?”

god- ” dear, because it is ready to take a new life and then turn to food to many more and give,share life to them!”

bindu asked” what if i choose my way to ocean and drop off there and be a part of that huge………. source?”

He smiled and said ” here comes the decision to listen to your heart or your mind child!! yes, the ocean is huge but if you just choose it because of the hugeness then you are noting to that because you’ll certainly become one among the whole thing and even you’ll share their salty nature… and after that you’ll be unknown for yourself too…you are just an ocean salty drop! there after…

now decision is in your hands child, whether to take ocean or to take seed!!!! ”

Certainly bindu takes off to seed!

Its a simple story about choosing the one who is in need of moral support and love care….rather then the one who is not even bother of others….
