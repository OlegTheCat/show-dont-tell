Social Issue Short Story – Everything is’nt the same

I was just playing my favorite track on my mobile with headphones in to my ears. It was a long journey of almost an hour and travelling into the bus without any means of entertainment would have killed me!!

As soon as the next stop came the driver stopped the bus. Only a girl of almost in her 20’s stepped up in the bus. As there were no seats, she had to stand for some while, almost until the next stop, as seats would get vacant on the next stop. For a while I once thought of offering my seat to her , but then I hesitated as I had to go long away and if once I leave my seat I wont get it back. She was looking tired and helpless, as if she might have not had for almost many days. She was looking uncomfortable at that moment. Her face was like ‘Please Help Me’

Meanwhile the next stop was about to come. An uncle geared up to get down off the bus on the next stop. Besides him was a guy of almost 25’s sitting. Uncle got up and the seat got vacant. Some ladies and other men in that bus signaled her to sit on that seat. But she hesitated. She looked at me. I gesticulated to her to sit on that seat. Still she hesitated, she was looking uncomfortable, but after some while she came forward and sat on that seat.

Some sort of relaxation ran in to my body. If I ever could get to talk to her, I would just say to her “Girl, the world around you is not that cruel the way you think. There are people in this world who will help you to rise up in your life, who will lift you up when you are in your bad phase. There are men in this world who wont try to look at your cleavage even if you wear short dress. There are people in this world who will make you smile even if you ain’t in a mood to do that. There are people in this world who will help you in every possible means.

The only effort you need to make is be cooperative. Take your time to find these people and just wait for a right moment”!
