A person named Hari use to believe in god very much..  Hari use to worship God everyday.  He also use to take care of his tree grown at his Backyard. He used to water it , clean the space around it and would collect all the fallen leaves. He was a very humble Person and lives with her mother.

The tree was much happy due to Kindness of hari. Hari used to collect all the fallen leaves in a small jute bag. Hari kept the bag at a corner of his home. Next Morning, He found that all the Leaves in the bag were shining like, they were of Gold.

In the Evening, Hari with his mother went to a Jeweler to check whether the leaves are really of gold or not. The jeweler checked the leaves and found it to be real. He thought of cheating Hari as he became greedy. He told Hari that these leaves were not of real gold but, they shine like gold and , I would give you bag full of wheat for this. Humble Hari accepted the offer of the jeweler and took the bag of wheat and mowed towards his home happily.

The jeweler was very happy of his work .  He thought of converting the Gold leaves into cash. And slept at that night. Next Morning, he woke and found all the gold leaves to be converted into snakes and crabs. They bite the jeweler.

Then , He understood what was his Mistake and went to Hari and paid full money equal to the price if that gold leaves. Hari and her mother were happy and forgave the jeweler for his bad work.

Moral: Good will always pay you in some or the other way. But,Bad work will always pay you in an opposite way like a punishment.
