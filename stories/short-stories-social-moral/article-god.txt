“GOD”…….I don’t know what this word really means and maybe nobody knows or can define what is God.

Maybe which is not known to anyone is God………..but,  who knows?

I, myself believe that God is a force, a force in nature which cures all, heals all and loves all. It resists us from doing wrong, but may be this force is minute over the force of our mind and heart. As if this force is stronger then why there were criminals? So if God is a force then he is smaller than us or may be we ourselves are the God of own self………but, who knows?

Who is God?………..God or We?

 God is God………maybe but, i am not sure……..maybe nobody will be. Although God is unknown to mankind since their origin, yet eagerness to know him remains to us as it was before. We don’t even know our origin and not of God too. So, who knows………maybe we are the God?

God means good.

 God stands for good,…….good behavior, good culture and every good things of the world. Although God is God, yet he must have humanity in his heart because humanity is the only element which makes one to help others in need. God loves everyone, helps everyone, heals everyone……….he does not discriminate, but we……..so we are not God. Because of the unmatched love and humanity in his heart, I will or maybe everyone will give full marks to God for his humanity………and of course full marks means good, so God is good.

God’s love is so wonderful.

 I always thought that why God hasn’t given us supernatural power like his own………but i didn’t found the answer, but i think that although he has not given us any supernatural power but, he has given us something which is more wonderful and valuable to us, his love……..immortal and divine, unmatched with any other thing of the world.

O God! thank you for this beautiful love.
