Anita was an intelligent student in her class. One day, her father came and told the family members” I will be transferred from Delhi to Lucknow. Fortunately, Anita and Amit(Anita’s brother) will complete their exams before my transfer and I hope that they will score good marks in exams.” Anita and her brother kept themselves busy in exam studies.

After the result of exams, both Anita and Amit went to Lucknow with their parents. When they reached to admission in the school, the principal began to her father “Sir, I have seen the result of Anita and Amit. They are brilliant students, but I am bounded with some rules and regulations.So, you will have to submit the capitation fees with tution fees.”

Her father told the principal ” I am an honest man. I can’t afford the expense of capitation fee. ”

Principal asked “But you are a government employee. You can earn a lot , in your job.”

Her father replied ” I haven’t taken bribe in my job. You are the root of corruption. You have started the business to create the corruption tree from your school. What is the role of Capitation Fees , if I have talented children? You have forced the parents to earn in other ways like corruption, black money, etc “.

Principal denied to admit his children.

Anita’s father decided to send their children to government school, instead of creating status symbol. Anita’s mother asked ” Why do you want to send them in government school?”

He said ” I have decided to send them in government school, because I want to educate my children with the reality of society. They can judge the financial status of poor people. Private Schools are famous in creating corruption in our country and they will grow, if we support us. I am an honest employee, and can’t take bribe.”

His wife agreed with his decision which was the small but correct step to eliminate the corruption in the country.
