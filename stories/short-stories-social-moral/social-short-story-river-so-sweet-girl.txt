This is a tale about a sweet water river. There lived a girl right by its bay. Every afternoon she would come there to cool herself down and see herself in it. She would say to the river” you are so sweet just if you could give me some of thee”, there would be no reply from the river and so towards home she would flee.

This happened everyday until one fine afternoon, the sun was out as usual and so were the birds. The wind blew as usual and so did the leaves, but there was something wrong in it all. As everyday the girl looked at the river and leaped into it. But to her dismay the water had gone stray (bitter). The girl cried and begged and pleaded for all she had ever said or done but all in vain. So she walked towards home sad with a heavy heart when she heard a sound. She ran towards it to see what it was.

There stood a big building called winter wood mill. And after that day on she would walk towards the mill without any reason as if her feet skid her there without her permission. The security guard would see her everyday and ask if she seeked someone or something, she would reply non, he would smile at her and let her in for some while. The girl wandered throughout the mill without any head or tail until one day she saw a terrible sight. She ran towards home and started crying.

Days passed by she did not eat not sleep or play. All at home were worried but one. It was her wise granny dear. She sat the girl down and looked her in the eye and asked her of her pain. The girl hugged her and cried to her hearts content and when she was done she told of her love for the river so sweet and of the terrible sight she saw at the mill.

At once the granny knew what had to be done, she gathered the village and marched towards the mill. They sat there for 3 long months until finally the mill came to a still. And that’s when the girl smiled again and ran towards her river to meet.

The mill was throwing its toxic waste in the river which made the water go bad.
