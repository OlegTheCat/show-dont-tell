Stands majestically rising over the court, grass perfectly trimmed. White lines sharply turning at the corners. The yells and cheers of the crowd echo throughout the day. Scream of triumph and frustration heard during play. The sun staring down, watching the action unfold. Players entering confidently and leaving disappointed. Day after day, people come and people leave, happy and sad. But in the end only one victor shall remain.

The greatest player of the tournament, success is key. The sweat and perseverance to earn the trophy. The rest of the players look on watching the proud man while he raises the trophy and the crowd erupts in cheers. The coaches look on with tears of joy for their creation has become the best player. Tennis is an intense sport, only the greatest can win. Yet many train and rack their brain to win a beautiful crown. In the end, the hard work is worth it. The trophy in their hands proves they are the best.

Everyone who lost will not give up. They will train and work harder. When next year comes around again, they will dethrone the victor. The winner has immense pressure to defend his magnificent title. The challenges he will face are impossible to imagine. Only time will tell if he can win again. For the last year, the beautiful grass courts have been forgotten about. Now, hundreds of people help show the courts perfection. Players, coaches, and spectators come from every corner of the world just to play on these courts. Something about its history makes it so amazing. Without Wimbledon, tennis wouldn’t be the same. The grass courts provide singularity in an ever-changing game. The bright yellow ball, the thick white lines, and the green grass make tennis the greatest sport. Tennis is majestic, beautiful, and entrancing.
