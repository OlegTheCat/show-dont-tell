I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL WRITER NEITHER I ASPIRE TO BE A WRITER , DON’T KNOW WHY JUST WANT TO SHARE MY WASTED BORING LIFE WITH YOU ALL. I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE IF GET BORED OR FRUSTRATED AFTER READING IT.  SO HERE IT STARTS :-

The name ” WASTED” was actually given by others to me from the start of my graduation year because :-

1) They felt that my reason for being irregular was my laziness ,

2) I just smoke and drink with a cheapo group ,

3) Not at all intelligent in studying,

4) I am not doing anything productive in my life.

But in a way they were 50 percent correct but still it didn’t matter to me so much at that time, That was their minor bitching against me otherwise everyone were good and friendly with me . Years went by and Ups n Downs took place in my life . And then finally the day arrive when i gave my final exam of graduation and thought that after 2-3 days of fun will improvise my life to a proper extent and now i was having the opportunity to dignify my life to others who thought i am a wasted person.

In the whole 3 years of my graduation i just heard that ” DUDE YOUR A GOOD PERSON AT HEART AND WE TREAT YOU AS OUR GOOD FRIEND AND YOU WILL BE OUR GOOD FRIEND IN THE FUTURE ALSO BUT YOU ACT LIKE A EMOTIONAL FOOL EVERY TIME AND YOUR LIFE IS A SUCH A WASTE . GO CHANGE IT MAN IT WILL BE BENEFICIAL FOR YOU.

This dialogue i heard many a times from them and only one thing was in my mind that let this graduation get over will show everyone how much wasted i am. So it started from 10th may when i got freedom and leaving for home i got a call from my college mates to reach at a restaurant. i headed with my another friend that day was a enjoyment moment , it captured really good memories in my mind.

Then the next morning i woke up i decided to make my life productive , to get involved in other things , think about some post graduation (PG) course and find out a part time job . In a way i wanted to do the PG for myself as i want to see myself as a post graduate in a specific field and wanted to take up a job for my family as they want me to get busy, to earn some money, if possible to help them or at least remove my own expenditure. BUT ALL WENT WRONG…….. What actually happened ?

Waking up in the morning 10-11-12 , a cup of coffee , smoking a cigarette , doing time pass with my dogs and like a formality starting up my laptop uploading resume in each and every websites , recruitment agencies expecting that i will get a practical job in which i will learn a lot of things . But as said by someone ‘EXPECTATION IS THE MOTHER OF ALL DISAPPOINTMENTS’.

That same BPO jobs, customer care executive , counter sales job etc….. A person who has appeared for graduation and in a few time he might become an Official graduate and he is receiving only these types of jobs, i still kept patient that will get a good job. During that period i had a word with my parents and they were not in the favour for me to study ahead . According to them i should take up a full time job earn and become a helping hand of my father and elder brother.

So i dropped my dream of studying further and decided to take up a job at least. Other friends are doing the job of Insurance agent , BPO/KPO/Customer service jobs etc but still i dont want to take up such type of job because its not only that i want to earn but i want to learn also. Because of my this mentality i am still unemployed , i sent mails to various firms where i expected i will learn a lot from them , even they also didn’t turn up to me.

Then i thought to apply for a Bank Clerical Job exam held every year of State Bank of India but unlucky me their registrations closed long back . Life is becoming simply boring , i am going nuts, Dullness has hit my life , my Bank account shows me an account balance of rs 98. My father is not giving me a single penny , my brother taunts me so much and gives me jus 20-30 rupees a day , mom doesn’t makes faces or gets angry she makes me understand to put more effort and i will get a good job , she knows that i am putting my effort and she believes that everything will  be better. This phase of my life is the worst phase , i just pray nobody become such a loser in life , a wasted vela.

In this phase NO JOB , NO GOOD RESULTS ( cant expect anything from my graduation also ), NO GIRLFRIEND, NO FRIENDS, EQUATION WITH MY FAMILY IS FADING.

Friends remember the saying ” LEARNING FROM YOUR MISTAKES AND FROM OTHERS MISTAKES AND MAKING CHANGES IN LIFE” can give you proper direction in life and will help your life becoming Simple, sweet , sober and sorted. Now its up to you all whether you want to repeat the mistakes like me , you want to be called as a wasted person in life or you want to learn from my mistakes and find betterment for your future. Think people think

Thank you
