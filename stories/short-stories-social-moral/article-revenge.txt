We all know that there are two sides of our facet. Positive and Negative. It is so difficult to nurture the positive side. Have we ever thought of it as to why ? Many writers have penned great phrases but did they live a life full of happiness. Happiness is not about a second persons perspective. It is about our feelings of being elated on any and every occasion. Positivity is generated and also transferred when we smile remembering moments from the Past.

But most of us only have flashbacks of troubled times and hardships. Even though we can balance our emotions we tend to frown. We think of means and methods to revenge those who had troubled us. We conceive plans and then finally put them to work.We ultimately succeed in our overtures and take our most awaited REVENGE. Our revenge.We feel most happiest at the top of the world. We have done what we had been plotting.

Now what! What after this? We have got used to it. We have now become similar to the person whom we were against.We keep waiting for what he/she would be saying or doing next that is what would be their next move. And accordingly what should be our response.Our mind is almost always preoccupied only to become most powerful by all means….good or bad. Now when we again sit back and think we find out that we have our self become a nonsense. All our freshness is lost. We are no more the same we were once.We have forgotten to forgive. We have forgotten to oblige. We have forgotten to smile.We now have no time to enjoy those small moments when the first rose of our garden blossoms or the first showers of the seasonal rains.

It is but humane to think of revenge. But it is not right to carry it forever.

We can ward off development of sad past by being simply truthful and straight…rather than wearing a false veil over our real self.
