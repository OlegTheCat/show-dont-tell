Christmas is all about happiness. Lights, gifts,food all these lights up the Christmas joy.

Little did we know that there are souls still hoping to know what really this day is. All he knows is that this day he wouldn’t die of starvation. This day won’t be his last day because he believes that the excess money the rich have is spent on food. All he has to do his wait patiently staring at these doors. Hoping to make his wish come true,which is indeed a peaceful sleep with a filled up stomach.

He sees people taking the trees that were once outside into their warm homes. Lighting it up ,filling it up with gifts. He regrets now being born a soul without no value. He wishes to be that dead tree himself . So at least for one day in a year he could feel what christmas is.

He hears people singing and chanting the Christmas joy. All he could do is mumble his freezing lips hoping that one day he would sing like them.

At last! he hears the  squeaking of the door as it is opened.A man stood in front of him,holding a bag. happiThe bag was not the key for his happiness. But to tell him that its time he leaves the place. All he did was greet the man with a smile as he hands the bag over to him.

A moment of happiness he had as he opened the bag. He found a slice of bread , a slice to make his sleep peaceful. He thanked god and thought to himself “why cant this day repeat itself forever”. All he now has to do is find a shelter within the streets. So that he could fulfill his dream.

As he lied down by the street light post. He thought to himself, people who once chased him away for starring at their houses greeted him with food and a tear dropped by as he shouted “I wish this day not to end”.
