What do you have to be thankful for? A raise? Your family? A medical miracle? Whatever you have to be thankful for, do it right. It is easy to be thankful for something that is obvious, like getting that raise, but what about the things in everyday life? Be thankful for waking up in the morning, and be thankful for getting in the bed at night. Taking time to reflect upon the things that we are thankful for are more likely to be happier than those who don’t.

Thanksgiving. It’s name tells us what the purpose of this wonderful holiday is. It’s not just about the turkey, ham, and cranberry sauce. It’s about getting with your family and expressing what you’re thankful for. I urge you to practice being thankful every day, and not just on November 24. Here are a few keys that you can use.

Get real about it. Notice the little things around you that you should be thankful for. If you do this, you will get into a habit of being thankful for the little things in life.

 Get creative about it. Find a fun way to keep track of what you are thankful for. Create a thanks jar. Get a jar, and everyday, write down something that happened, which you are thankful for. At the end of the year, empty it, and review your response.

 Be social about it. Don’t just be thankful for the things that benefit you. Be thankful for things that benefit others at well.

I hope that you take my tips into consideration. It will give you a positive life style!
