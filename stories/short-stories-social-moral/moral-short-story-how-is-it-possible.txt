Stars were twinkling in the sky. The moon light was very cold and heart-touching, but Lakhan was unable to sleep. He said to his father, “Dad, please tell me a story.”

His father was convinced with him. He slept near him and said, “There was a great person in India. He was known as ‘Sai Baba’. The people worshipped him, but some people were jealous of him.

One day a man came to ‘Sai Baba’ and said, “Oh, great god, there is a big problem of water in my village. Please come and help us.”

Sai Baba went to his village. ‘Sai Baba’ stopped there near a stone. He said to the villagers, “You will get water near the stone, dug the earth around it. The villagers did so and they got a lot of water.

When Sai Baba was about to return, a women come to him and said,” Baba, my husband is very ill. The doctor is saying that he is no more, please help me. The Baba went to her house. He just touched her husband and her husband opened his eyes”.

Raman said, “How is it possible? Science has proved that there are many ways to find the water, but a man cannot awake a dead person.”

His father wasn’t convinced with him. After a little time, they both slept.

Next morning, Raman read the news that an honest man had been killed for his honesty. His name was ‘Satyendra Dubey’. People wanted justice for him. They are doing strikes. A news channel presented a drama on the whole life of ‘Satyendra Dubey’.

There were tears in the eyes of Raman after seeing the drama. Raman said to his father,

“Now I am convinced with you, dad. When Satyendra Dubey can awake hundreds of sleeping people of India from a deep sleeping then Sai Baba also can awake a man from deep sleeping.”
