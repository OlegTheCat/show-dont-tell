It wasn’t good enough but still she went.

Some college students were there in the train, observing her, and not knowing what’s on her mind, they started thinking that she was crying because she was missing her love, they thought she was upset because maybe a particular song reminded her of her boyfriend,though they had nothing to do with this girl,they misunderstood her and started laughing about it.

They never saw such a wanna-be before,who’s so crazy and desperate to grab people’s attention that she preferred crying publicly.

Some other passengers got into the train and sat on the blank seats of those college students, observing her,

 she was laughing, joking around, singing and enjoying the journey.

 They never saw such a happy person before,who’s 

It was a short journey but made her change her views.

 The passengers didn’t know that just before they got into the train, she was crying.

The students, who never knew her, never imagined that she would be happy,a few moments later.

 But the most important part is she didn’t know any of them,she will never meet any of them again.
