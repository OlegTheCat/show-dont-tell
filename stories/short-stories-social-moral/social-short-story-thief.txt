There was a thief named Hag, he was born in a very poor place where his used to thrive to keep up a good future for Hag, but it wasn’t possible as money doesn’t drops down from a money tree. Hag grew up by stealing things from people.

One day he decided to take a big step by deciding to break into a house, whose owner was Loin. As the door was locked, he found a way to get into the house, the window! He climbed and got inside the house and he saw a lot of shiny things, but did he notice? He was in Loin’s bedroom! Loin woke up with a large bang that Hag made when he fell off the stairs, he started searching the house and he finally found Hag. Hag tried to run, but Loin stopped him by jumping on him and tying his hand with a rope he had never him.

Loin was like, “Yeah, you should always have a rope near you for backup!”.

He called the police and the police took Hag to the police station, however Loin decided to give him a visit and also bail him out as he was a young teen and Loin knew that this was going to destroy his future. Loin bailed him out and said, “Do not destroy your future even through you don’t have money, who knows? You might become a rich man one day. Always follow the good path and never follow the bad path”.

From that day, Hag painted and made a lot of great painting which people bought it a lot. By doing that, Hag become a great artist and never ever decided to follow the bad path again.

Morale: Never destroy your future by following the bad path, always follow the good path and you’ll surely do good.
