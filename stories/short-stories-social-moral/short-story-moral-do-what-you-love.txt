There was once a man his name was Raja who had a lot of responsibilities. He worked so hard that he never had a party for even his birthday. However he had more and more problems for money.

He once asked his wife, Rani “Rani Can I ever have a party with these problems?”

Rani answered “Raja it would have been possible if you had money for the home needs but, alas you don’t”.

Raja was very sad with the answer. He thought about it. He thought whether worth leading a life with no time for a party or enjoyments. The next morning he did not go to work. His wife was most surprised she asked him

“what is the matter why are you not going to work. It has never happened like this before. Do you have fever or what?”

Raja answered sadly “my dear, I have decided to never go to work; instead I will go to a wedding planner’s office and work there at least I will be able to have fun while I work”

The wife agreed as her husband was happy for a job. Ever since he married her he went to work in the same office. Rani understood her husband’s feeling. She told Raja to find job at any Wedding planner’s office. Afternoon  Raja set out from the house in search of a job. Evening,  Raja came home jubilantly  shouting,

“I got the job. I will start from tomorrow morning my job is to do decorations at functions and weddings”

Rani was indeed happy for her husband. The next morning Raja was ready in his new uniform, smiling. Rani happily packed the boxes and gave it to her husband. A few weeks passed and news came that Raja had paid his loan fully and that Raja was promoted as the manager in his office.

Rani was surprised and asked Raja “Raja how did this happen? How come you liked this job so much?”

Raja smiled and answered “dear Rani, I am happy with my job, making others happy and seeing the others so happy gives me a great satisfaction so I am happy too.”
