Short Story Scial – Pay for the Lie

Swapnil and Haru of almost same age used to work in the same field. They were good friends from very childhood. But not very sure of the reason why Haru used to envy Swapnil very much.

Swapnil was very hard working and had a good knowledge of agriculture. There were almost no seeds which Swapnil used to sow did not grow. But Haru in this case was a bit unlucky. Not that he had no knowledge and was not hard working, but almost all his seeds used to die. May be because of this Haru in actual used to envy Swapnil’s luck.

As a result of this Haru really was scared that how many days could he work in this field. Its almost better to engage a person with no knowledge and instruct him to sow the seeds and make the seeds grow into plant getting his lucky touch than to keep a knowledgeable but unlucky person like Haru.

So one day, as usual when Swapnil’s seeds all survived and not his, he just waited for the owner of the field to arrive. And no sooner did he arrive than Haru started shouting,

“Babu how will you identify my portion?? The portion where all the seeds have survived is my portion. I do indeed have luck, don’t I?”

In this the owner was really happy, gave him some more seeds than actually he was supposed to get and rewarded him and also warned Swapnil to get some more knowledge from Haru about how actually he should sow the seeds to make them get converted into plant.

Swapnil was a bit annoyed with this. He quickly played one trick. He immediately turned towards the owner, who was about to leave the field and softly told,

“Sir why doesn’t Haru in that case then take the responsibility of sowing the seed in all of ours portions till we get fully educated on the know how!!!”.

The owner thought for sometime and then agreed to this and went away.
