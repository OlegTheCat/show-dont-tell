 from 

One day I went for Tea in the evening, when I came back room was locked and my roommate wasn’t there. For Long time I waited in front of the room and I cursed that situation because it’s too bad. At that time many thoughts on my mind its all about God because he put me in that situation also I’m poor ,not luxurious, I hate myself because of this. At that time I just

 asked to god

“You wouldn’t give money its ok , You wouldn’t give a girlfriend its ok , why wouldn’t you come in-front of me

 Are you afraid of me..?”.

Many times I want to meet god for just ask “why you made me what the purpose me..?”. He never ever answered me.

After one hour my roommate came He said “why you waiting outside..? The key is there under lamp”.

I look at that there is a lamp with the symbol of God Shiva under that there is the room key, for that room key I waited about one hour.

I realize that it is warning or a message because all the religions say God is the Truth,the way and the Light.

 After that I changed my mindset. Now I believe in god. Because he want me become a wise man not become rich man. Because money isn’t a stable thing as like wisdom. Wisdom made money, money not made wisdom. After some days I got campus interview letter of Windcareindia private limited and I got the job, But I really want to become an writer like  Shakespeare and Leo Tolstoy. I know my story not much good to entertain you but this is just starting. Without food we can live up to five days,without water we can live one day and without breathing oxygen you can’t live one second but food is costly than oxygen. I’m a simple man not worthy for you but also I have valuable mind.

Fear about God is Wisdom- Bible
