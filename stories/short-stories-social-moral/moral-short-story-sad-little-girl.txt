There was a girl named Jamie, she in fact used to get bullied everyday at school, people used to treat her like she was not a human at all. The thing was, people often used to underestimate her because she wasn’t good at doing things like studying, playing sports, etc. She was going over choices like if she wanted to end up her life or maybe continue it, wait for something good to happen whatsoever.

Her mom saw and asked her “Babe, you look sad.”, she said “It’s nothing, mom”.

Moms often know what we’re thinking and she knew that something was going around with her, so she sat down with her and said “Babe, the world is cruel and the best thing is that never give up on your life because one day you’ll become a great person”, she said with a great smile and Jamie also smiled.

During the final exams she brought more marks than all the students that were underestimating her and making fun, and the people who did that got embarrassed.

Jamie was like “No need to get embarrassed, because you all are my friends and I respect you all”, the people who often used to bully her everyday and make fun of her were not the same anymore, they all became her friends because they knew that underestimating people is not the option, guiding them the correct way is the option.

After that Jamie had a happy ending instead of a sad ending, just like the cartoon animations or maybe other movies?

You all do know that, sad isn’t the only word because there is another word named happy. Always stay happy and never give up on your life.

Morale: Never underestimate people.
