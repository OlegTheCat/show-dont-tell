Three slum children whose life were indulged in drinking, smoking they were working for their gang leader Sultan. After doing all their bad activities they took some time and just stare the other children playing football in nearby ground. One day one teacher approached them and ask if they were interested to play, the boys first didn’t understand and ignored him then teacher offer to give 50rs each if they played, the boys agreed. It continues for many days the boys come, play and took the money. Day by day they started enjoying playing football.

One day teacher said he doesn’t have any money to give them, one of the boy named Akhilesh said they don’t want money they just want to play football. It further continued for many days, boys were very happy.

Their gang leader sultan finds out these boys or not doing their work as they were told instead they spent most of time playing football, he got very angry and beats one of the Akhilesh friend’s. Akhilesh got frightened very much, he doesn’t know where to go. At last he goes to the teacher’s house and started crying, the teacher understand the boy is scared and needs some help and guidance or else it will crush & destroy him. So he decides to give some of his saving to this boy and ask him to leave the town and all the bad habits he is onto and start a new life. Akhilesh took money and leave but he couldn’t understand how can someone be so generous and kind towards him.

4 years later someone came to visit the teacher, it was non other than akhilesh with trophy in his hand which he got in football scholarship. They look into each other for sometime and hugs. Akhilesh asked his teacher why???did he help him as nobody not even his parents have done something for him.

Then the teacher explains, that he hasn’t done anything, for the time they were in the ground they didn’t do smoking, they didn’t rob somebody, they didn’t beat somebody, it’s the game that distracted him.

He agrees with him and realize that sports(football) had helped him because when we play something we didn’t know what is happening in the world our whole concentration is on the sports.

Akhilesh cries and touch his teacher feet’s.
