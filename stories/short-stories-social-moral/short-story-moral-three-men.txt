Sun Set through tree

Once there were three men they were Ravi, Shankar and Ashok. They were very poor but they didn’t care as they had friends who used to make them forget the world. They were best friends.

Once, they all lost their jobs because of their carelessness and this broke their hope and confidence completely. Ravi and Shankar were the most disappointed and they decided that their life was nothing and it will be nothing for their entire life and decided to be beggars. However Ashok didn’t lose hope in fact he went to find another job though, his friends leaving him alone deeply disappointed him  as they were the only people he ever had in his life. He worked as a night guard in a rich person’s  mansion. He worked hard and hard and at last found himself a wife and they had two children at last he became rich.

Whenever he had time of leisure he used to think about his friends how they might be right now. He worked hard until he grew old and old.

One day on his way to the hospital expecting his grandchild he saw his friends on the footpath lying and begging for money. He got out of the car and went to them with tears in his eyes  “my friends how did this happen?”.
