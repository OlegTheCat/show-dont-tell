Savita was beautiful, but poor and illeterate, She was a maid in a man’s house, but was very brave and intelligent, let’s see how she helped herself without any support, her owner was rich but bad charactered, he molested her, and it so happened that there was no one to support Savita, neither her family, neighbors, nor the cops. Savita was not allowed to enter the house, She was blamed charactereless for no fault of her, She was kicked out of her society too.

She had no shelter, no food, and it was so difficult being a woman, but she was brave and strong. She was threatened to be beaten black and blue, be killed,and also tried to be stabbed and pulled under a bulldozer.

She went to the man’s house and built a hut outside with a paper sign board written by an unknown person by giving him her gold bangle away, ” I need justice, I am ready for any kind of examinations, Is that man ready?, I need Justice”, Why am I taking nonsense for no fault of mine?”.

The people crossing by, read it and of curiosity many people spoke to her and heard her story, they gave her food, clothes and work, of compassion and kindness.

Her story slowly spread, and woman help association stood with her, got her examined, proved that she was molested and the father of her child was this man. Out of peer pressure, and to maintain his false dignity he had to marry her. His first wife divorced him, and he is paying for her maintainence.

The most surprising part is that Savita runs a school today, inspite of being an illeterate, and is living a happy, respectable and a descent life. She started her journey as a maid, she has 50 people working under her now. What can be more inspiring and a true example of “Never give up spirit and true intelligence and wits” than this.
