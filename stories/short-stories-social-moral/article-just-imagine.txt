English Article – Just Imagine.

(c) YourStoryClub.com

When my mind wanders off into deep space I cannot ignore the basic thoughts that are always in the back of my mind, for example, Whenever I zone out of reality I think to myself how lucky I am to be alive and how fragile my existence is since the probabilities of me existing are the same as two million people rolling trillion-sided dice and all landing on the same number.

I imagine whether reality is actually real or if we were put into machines where we can only portray what we think to be reality, where the actual reality is something so complicated that we can’t imagine. I imagine going into a wormhole and travelling billions of light years into the other ‘end’ of the universe where there could be an abundance of intelligent extraterrestrial life. Our imagination is so grand yet we use it for the most idiotic things at times.

Our minds are faster and stronger than a thousand of the world’s fastest supercomputers combined; and yet after a couple million years on earth we haven’t been able to explore more than 10 percent of our world’s oceans. We puny humans may have strong, yet weak minds but there is no wrong in imagining. I wonder how Einstein thought about gravity before anyone else did, how did no one before him stop to think,

“Hmm… What could be holding us down? How come we cannot touch the stars or jump on the moon?”

Someone must’ve thought of it, probably scared that they would be thought to be crazy they said nothing; what a waste of a brain if one cannot stop to think and just imagine, because if you haven’t noticed yet, Imagination as valuable as any physical object that your eyes will ever be able to bestow upon.
