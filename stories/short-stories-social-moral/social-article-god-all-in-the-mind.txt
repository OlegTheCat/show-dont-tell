The more I think the more I realize that a mind has infinite creativity. We have to understand that God is nothing/ no one. God was an imagination, a creative mind has invented the concept of God and very interesting tales of how miracles were performed. I know this statement is going to raise a lot of criticism. Just like Stan Lee, He created the ‘Marvel Comics Universe’, he created some ‘iconic’ creatures. Stan made me believe in the things that never existed nor will ever. 

A school of thought suggests that God’s existence is purely incidental, just to hide/justify the after effects of someones doings. The concept of God was created to infuse fear, just like the concept of ‘society’. We’ll get to that in my other article. There are a few conspiracy theories that support the idea of God being the ultimate conspiracy theory created by man. The lack of logic in the stories behind God and his stories is the main reason for the defiance. For the people who believe that Lord Ganesha actually was made out of Goddess Parvati’s body dirt and the elixir of life. Also, his face is that of an elephant and neck-down he has a human body. 

I am not here to challenge anyone’s beliefs. I just think that someone needs to speak up. Let people understand that these shackles of so-called religion, weigh them down. The more we fear, the more they are going to threaten. Osho was once asked, “Do you believe in God?” to which he replied, “I do not believe in the concept of believing”. What Osho meant was that for having faith in something we need to know how it looks/feels like. The debate is never-ending.  

So you decide are you mind-controlled or are you set-right. Existence of ‘God’, is it all in the mind? or Does the ‘God’ really exists?
