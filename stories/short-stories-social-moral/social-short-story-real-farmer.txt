Social Short Story – The Real Farmer

There was one King in one village. One day he went for a round to visit all the cultivated lands in his village. He was so amazed that he just stood still and started glaring at one field. He started telling his most wise minister by his side who also was there with him during the round,

“How come in this season also, unlike other fields, this field has so many trees survival? I just want to give reward to the farmer who has worked hard for this field.”

Hearing this news all the farmers of his village gathered in his court and everyone tried to convince that he was there actually in charge of that field and so he should be awarded. King was in a tough situation to decide and so handed this case over to his wisest minister Swapnil, to decide who actually worked hard on that field.

Swapnil while rising from his chair started telling “Jahapana, before deciding who actually should be awarded for this wonderful act, should we not decide on the quantity of reward that should be awarded? Jahapana, I feel lets divide this in two parts. For one pumpkin tree lets pay one gold coin and for one white pumpkin tree lets give 2 gold coins, since you prefer white pumpkin more than pumpkin”

Moment Raja agreed to that, each farmer started shouting “So I would be paid for 100 pumpkin trees and 200 white pumpkin trees”,

“No, I would be paid for 200 pumpkin trees and 400 white pumpkin trees.” and so on.

But only one farmer told “Jahapana, accordingly I would get paid for only 207 pumpkin trees since there is no white pumpkin tree in that field”

Immediately Swapnil pointed that farmer and told Raja, “Jahapana that person would get paid since he is the one who laboured for this field. This is because I knew from beforehand that a situation would arise like this and so confirmed from beforehand that, that field has all pumpkin trees.”
