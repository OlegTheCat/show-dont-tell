No one will understand you. No one will notice your right side. The more you give in, and it reflects back sadness and disappointments. 

Care, affection and love all fall off in the trap of money. The money itself control all of these. The desire among family fades without cash. All you need is money. Our happiness, joy and laughter need money. 

 Money!!! Money!!! Money!!!

 This same money turn someone terrible into good .  And the good into bad. Criticising for no money and praising you because you have the money.

 It’s such a disgrace for humanity and it’ shows animal a magnificent creature than us. 

 An animal is loyal and lovable. These animals don’t degrade based on money and switches on the side when blinded by money. 

The worst when your family does the same thing as the third person would do. It’s hurtful, hatred and anger all burst into the form of tears. My eyes were sunken with tears expressing the deep cut of my heart. A mixture of feelings piled up and couldn’t even show. It just makes me look stupid and worthless.

Yes, I’m worthless and what I’ve done at least not to mention but at least the rest of members shouldn’t be grateful for it. Don’t ever look down when that person just appeared and change things around you for a moment that’s it and you look so high everything about him. Yeah I know he has money to spend for you guys, but it’s just a day and not give a shit when you’re really needed. 

 A single day spent wouldn’t help to solve all your problem, housing loan, electrical bills and all these minor stuff haven’t taken count. That damn money dumped all these.

I can’t digest it. These worlds so cruel and I realise it be good, don’t be too good and help for yourself. As that ways, you’ll be delighted. No matter what one has to remember, money is not everything. Love not to define money. But least people mean it — the only trust your only soul that’s your self.
