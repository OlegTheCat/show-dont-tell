 from 

Expectations are unending and so are the desires which drive human action and behaviour  It was a tense week, Pallavi’s parents want too much from her. She is not good at studies and her parents want to make her outperform. She goes daily to her school, attends all her classes but still an average student and a normal human being.

She wants to see her parents happy for which she can do anything. She attends tuition’s, takes help of her friends and sometimes even scolded and beaten up by her father. Still their is not much improvement as desired by her parents. She has tried all things she can but overall she has some capacities and limitations to which all fail to understand. Everyone tells something or the other and she is surrounded by so many tips & directions. And she is stuck up and confused ” What to do and what not “. Getting success in future has become her motto & in doing so she is losing something that can never be returned her present time & her childhood.

She is surrounded by so many thoughts and small enough & fails to understand that no one can ever achieve 100%.  You can be close to it but cannot completely have it. The God she believes in and goes to pray for cannot answer her questions which she asks Him daily that When her parents love her for being what she is & not for what she will be.

Are only material rewards important or she. She grows up constantly trying to outperform and now she is an adult but still her performance is average only and sometimes even deteriorated. She has a heavy heart and soul and the only answer she has found of her questions is that ” I Am Not God”.
