This is the story about a person who faced the real exam in his life and couldn’t succeed. What is the reason behind this? Who is the looser and who is responsible for this situation? What are the situations behind this stage?

Sanjeev was the student studying in 10th class. He was studying in the school where his parents were the owner of the school. They always try to pass his son with good marks in school by pressurizing the teachers of their school. They also used to correct the mistakes done by their child in the exam papers.

Now, Sanjeev was studying in 10th Class. One day, after the completion of pre-board exams in the school , his maths teacher told his parents,” your ward is weak in mathematics . Please give special attention to your ward otherwise he will not passed in the  board exam.”

But his parents begun to scold the teacher.

The teacher got irritated from his parents and said,” I want to make you understand that if your child will not get passing marks, then you will be responsible”.

They begun to threat of dismiss him from the job. After that, the teacher couldn’t say anything from his parents due to fear of losing his job because he was the only earning member in his family among seven members in his own family.

The fear of Sanjeev’s teacher was right regarding the board examination. When the result of board exam was seen by Sanjeev’s Parents , he got only third division with compartment in mathematics. Then his parents called his teacher and felt sorry for their rude behaviour .

The teacher said ,” As I have already told , you are responsible for this condition. You will have to give proper attention on him because this is the real life exam of your child. “
