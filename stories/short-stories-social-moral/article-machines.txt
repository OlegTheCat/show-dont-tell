I am writing an article to show all the aspects of role of machines in today’s life because machines became an important part in our everyday life which is as follows : –

Machine is a kind of instrument which makes our work easier in everyday life. Machines play an important role in our life to work easily and make our life simple.

Modern age is the age of science. Science gifted us many kind of machines like Electricity, Fans, Vehicles, Computer, etc. Machines play an important role and it saves our time in our daily life. We use machines for our work in everyday life which is becoming an important part to work easily and live our life easily. For example, we travel by Aeroplane and can cover the distance easily rather than travelling by Train for 24 hours which makes our travel easy and saves our time from one place to another.

But everything has two aspects – one is positive and other is negative just like “Head and Tail of a Coin”. In our everyday life, we are totally dependent on machines and we don’t want to do work which is necessary for our daily exercise. We use vehicles like bike, cars, etc. to cover small distances rather than travelling by foot.

Now-a-days, we are totally depending on machines which can create problems for our life. For example, we are becoming addicted to stay in Air Conditioned rooms and avoid to take fresh air which is not good for our health.

We can say that machines are useful to our everyday life. But we are becoming fully dependent on machines which is not good because ” Excess of everything is Bad” . So, it is necessary to use machines in a limit , not in excess because we will have to ” STOP OURSELVES TO BECOME SLAVE OF MACHINES’ in our daily life.
