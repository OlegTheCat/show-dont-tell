Abida, a dream girl from a small town of Punjab. She was the youngest of three sisters. She belongs to a mediocre and traditional Punjabi family where girls were not given much importance. Her parents did not plan her birth but their wish to have a boy brought her to this world. 

With the grace of God, she got loving grandparents and an elder sister named Mohini. They pampered her and tried to give her all the happiness of the world. At the age of 7, she was sent to the day boarding school in Punjab, which was one of the costliest school of its time. 

She was so fascinated by the environment of the school. From this place, journey of her dreams got started. She had her first dream in class 5 that she stood first in class, every night she found herself standing on the stage with the prize in her dreams. 

Then with time, her dreams got changed. A boy named Kavanpreet came in her life when she was in 10th standard. He was an NRI guy who was two years senior to her. Now she started dreaming of getting married to him, but her dreams got shattered when she left school because her parents got shifted to Agra because of their business. 

In Agra, she started studying in college, which belongs to some religious community. Here she started getting dreams of becoming famous and winning a director’s medal. Now she found herself standing at a stage with the director’s medal. Then one more boy came to her life who taught her what is the real meaning of friendship and told her that all her dreams would become a reality if she starts working on them. 

She was so surprised that after meeting that boy she came out of her dreamland and started living in reality.
