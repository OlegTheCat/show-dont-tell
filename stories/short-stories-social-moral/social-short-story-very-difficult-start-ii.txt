A little while later came two sisters with plate of food and gave two bites of food to the girl and to the man. This was the first time she heard his voice coarse and low.

“What is it” she thought. The man may be handsome one. Now the girl was led to a small door which led to a room which was set for her. It was very clumsily arranged. The bed was covered with a mosquito net. The girls clothes were simply thrown in the cupboard. There were no flowers hanging around the bed or even a single flower spread on the bed.

The girls heart sank at the look of it. She now sat with only last hope that perhaps the man she married even though his height was short may be handsome one, same like she had read in novels of silhouette romance. But this feeling was short lived. Now came the man , she raised her big beautiful kohled eyes to see not only a short man but also double chinned, round bellied, frog faced man. The girl instantly felt as though a huge chandelier made of glass had fallen to the ground and got shattered into pieces. She was in a state of shock. But she gathered her state back, still irreparable damage had been done.

The next morning she saw most of her hairs in the middle parting had turned white. She felt as though everything was over. What she had been waiting for, her dreams of a perfect match was all over. She now only wanted to die. Whenever she looked at the man she just felt as though she wanted to commit suicide. But she was not strong enough to let herself die. She changed, she stopped laughing, she curled into a shell.

MORAL:THANK THE CREATOR FOR WHAT HE HAS GIVEN RATHER THAN ASK AND BE SAD OF DESTINY.
