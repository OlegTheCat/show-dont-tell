Short Story – Fickle-minded

Well, here’s another boring day of myself. Writing stuff doesn’t really show my personality, of who I am in this world, or maybe, I should have asked the world, WHO AM I?.  I keep on changing my thoughts, in other words, FICKLE-MINDED, who me?. (Yes, you are dear). I don’t actually have appropriate plans, co’z everything in me is INAPPROPRIATE. I don’t know how my parents taught me to be flexible in anything. When I decided this kind of thing, I feel good, later on, I feel bad. So that’s how it goes of being a FICKLE-MINDED person, just like the weather, by season.

I have lots of lots of friends and believe me, all of them have their own decisions in life. They’re stable actually. My personality sucks, an anomalous attitude. If there are opportunities for me, I recanted and then I blamed myself of rejecting it. See?, how this destiny of mine deluded  me. I don’t have that kind of strong fortitude like anybody else. This sort of thing seems like a hanging sword in my head. Banging there and everywhere. Duh!, it hurts dude!.

When we meet, they share their love stories, full of erotic echos. Hard to admit but, I kind of envy them. In my whole life, love life is abysmal for me.  When I like someone, I got attracted, but then on the next day, here’s another winsome guy I met, and then, the next thing I know,  I unknowingly wrote countless names of guys whom I like.  Well, sweety, my life in your love life world is not really that saccharine or enthralling. The situation is skittish.

I was a tail who always followed dogs at home. In other words, I always kept my obedience whenever my parents told me not to have any boyfriends while at school. It was actually a belligerency for me to avoid those cute guys. In fact, I even hid that stupidity of not showing them how I like them too. GRRRRR… but anyway, that was DONE. What’s in the past remains in the past. I can’t undo it, but I can do it in my present life.
