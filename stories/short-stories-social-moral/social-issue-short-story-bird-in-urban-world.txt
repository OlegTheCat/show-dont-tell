Hey, I am Jake. I live in Mumbai yes the place where there are a ton of humans or like we call them the walkers, the best part about having these walkers are their tendency to get angry at us. These walkers give us birds the best mornings. Like every day they will be in a rush and we just happen to spot them and take a dump on them and then the fun starts, they get so irritated and try throwing stuff at us. Yes, sometimes I feel bad but like who tells them to walk right under.

Anyways its hard to live in these cities as the water here is so unclean. So my friend Marty and I head out to schools and parks where sometimes these walkers leave these taps on so we can drink of it. So Marty is a Parrot and I am a Crow, Yes a crow that everyone hates cause I do not look that great, but people do not know that crows are known for our intelligence. We might not look like Marty or talk like him but if u teach us something we will always remember It.

The urban places do not like birds like me cause they think we ruin places, we do not look great so we spoil pictures, but they do not realize how great we are at doing things other birds are not capable of. My brothers and sisters have been killed and injured by people who think they are greater than us and throw stones at us. Well Every story doesn’t have a happy ending nor does this, today a kid threw a stone at me even tho I tried to be friendly, I think these walkers just like things that are great. I am going to leave Mumbai as it isn’t a place for me, A crow in an Urban world is like a soul in a place it doesn’t get appreciated.

Conclusion: If you see a crow in an urban area like If you a person where you do not belong go to a place where you can be like a parrot and you are appreciated and you will shine brightly.
