Long ago when man worshiped gods and gods believed in humanity the gods came down from the heavens and made personal relationships with the mortal women who gave birth to children known as demi-gods half human half God.the gods gave birth to many children but it was one demi-god who was going to go down in history as the first to turn on the heaven’s.

Across the vast lands on a old farm a women gave birth to a boy, during her delivery she perished once he entered the world. As the child cries filled the air alone travelers could not help but notice the sorrows of a child. The traveler came into the ruins and noticed the child by the mortal remains and picked the child up and wrapped him up in a soft cloth he found beneath the frivolous body. He said from here on you will be known as Zyathien. Why zyathien – prince of hope, strength and finding your way etc.

In time as the child came of age the old man had passed.zyathien was on his own. At the age of 8 zyathien came part of society in the city of modur causeing havoc stealing and turning the kingdom into his playground.zyathien had no memory of his mother and only a faint memory of the old man as time passed the boy made a friend name Turk that lived in the streets of the kingdom just like him the two broke rules of the city and made a complete mess of things.

Not long after that the king banished the two boys to the out lands and told them never to return.the first day in the out lands zyathien and Turk came upon the woods outside the kingdom zythian spoke

“there is another city just beyond these woods”

Turk shared the same passion of troublemaking as zyathien but not the same bravery.Turk said in a brave but soft spoken voice

“I heard story’s about those woods anybody that has went in those woods never returned”

zyathien spoke has my dear friend spirit of adventure been replaced with that of a mouse” “no” Turk replied

zyathien spoke “well lets go and make our way thru the woods an onto to the city”

as they approached the woods a old stopped in the front of them-

“beware the creature that lies in the middle of the woods”‘

Turk said cre cre creature he quickly looked at zyathien and seen what the man had spoken to them did not make zyathien any less braver than what he already was

“move old man we are going in”

“zyathien ” spoke any creature that lies in the middle of those woods should be afraid for I don’t believe in or seen such things your story doesn’t shake my spirit old man.the old man paused and began walking and slowly turned around and spoke again heed my warning beware the creature in the woods”

Turk and zyathien entered the woods. Turk couldn’t help but notice the dark damp woods covered with dead leaves “zyathien” Turk spoke

“do u think what the old man was telling us is the truth,I got a bad feeling about this place” Turk spoke.

“hush” zyathien spoke softly you hear that somethings coming right at us.footsteps and crackling of old branches that laid on the ground of the woods that was once distance became Closer and closer

“Turk watch out!” zyathien yelled “watch out’!

turk leaped quickly into a pile of dead leaves zyathien quickly picked up a thick branch lying next to the old rugged tree and held it for a moment and yelled out “I know its you old man for my spirit still knows no fear” “swoosh” zyathien fell to his knees stop with the tricks!”show yourself!” he yelled.

zyathien then whispered to Turk stay down the foot steps came from a distance and got closer zyathien swung the thick branch and hit what appeared to be a man but the lower body of a goat next to the goat was a pitch fork very unique silver with carvings engraved into the pitch fork which looked like the ocean tides.zyathien approached the fork Turk yelled “no you don’t know what it is it could be dangerous”

zyathien looked at Turk and spoke dangerous and danger is what we live for my friend. zyathien stepped over the creature and reached for the staff before he touched the staff the creature jumped up and yelled “no!” Zyathien grabbed the Triton and before his eyes a huge lighting bolt flashed in the front of his eyes and what seemed to shake the Forrest only had blinded zyathien for a second as zyathien vision started to clear and what he seen was a man covered on gold platted armor with a cape as white as the clouds in the heavens

zyathien notice the goatman had bowed and said “sorry I have have failed you”t

he man spoke you did well. zyathien spoke with rage why did that creature attack us!”,who are u.the creature spoke I didn’t attack u if I did u wouldn’t be here right now zyathien gripped the Triton tighter.,I thought u was Hades followers I took that Triton from him what he took along time ago from another god that what you hold in your hand is the Triton Poseidon the God of the sea the creature spoke.enough hand it over the man said zyathien spoke who are u the man said I’m Zues and sense u know me who are u and how are u able to weld to Triton no mortal man can weld a Gods weapon zyathien gripped the Triton even tighter the creature spoke he must be a Demi before the creature could finish Zues yelled what’s your name boy”zyathien out the bushes came Turk he spoke I over heard u guys talking your the great zues I heard so much about you but Zues stood there with a look on his face as if he found something

zyathien yelled” you’r not my father!”

Zues spoke ” yes I am you lost your mother as she gave birth and as a God I couldn’t interfere.”

Zyathien pointed the Triton at zues and yelled “lies” Turk said stop that’s zues the actual zues. zyathien spoke I don’t care he speaks lies. the creature said don’t do this put it down kid. zues then spoke come with me and we can return the triton the belongs to my brother together and u can take your place in the heavens come with me zyathien yelled “no” and zapped zues and then the creature. zyathien then yelled to Turk come on.as the two made they way out the woods. Turk yelled what was that do you know what you just did zyathien spoke watch your tongue” Turk spoke you need to get rid of that Triton its changing you

Turk said you are my friend and this isn’t us this is beyond us its beyond you I’m a God now and I need no one zyathien spoke and then pointed the Triton at Turk and before he could unleash his rage on Turk a lightning bolt flashed in front of the two it was zues return the staff and this could end now zyathien pointed the Triton at zues and unleashed a powerful blast at zues as zues dodged the attack he threw a lighting bolt hitting zyathien.zyathien figure sense this is the Triton of the God of the see ill be better off by the ocean shore zues threw another lighting bolt sending zyathien across the ground zues yelled “end this now zyathien unleashed the power of the Triton blinding zues zyathien ran towards where water tides was clashing against the rocks he followed the sound and found what he was looking for the ocean.

He stepped in the water in the sky he saw zues flying toward him zyathien stuck the Triton in the water and created water giants and the giants engaged zues in battle as zues was distracted by the giants zyathien unleash the Triton full power knocking zues out the sky the water giant evaporated zyathien stood over zues and spoke this is when I go down in history and humanity speak of the great zyathien slaying the Almighty zues goodbye father”a voice from a distance caught zyathien attention “stop” it was Turk zyathien wrapped zues up in a ball of water and zyathien started towards

Zues rose to the sky and softly spoke “sorry my son” and unleashed the wrath of the heavens into one single lighting bolt and launched it where zyathien was stuck striking zyathien the blast from zues killed him. Turk slowly walked over to him and picked up the Triton as zues came down from the sky Turk said thank u now I can return the what belongs to my father zues said don’t thank me a gap in the sea arose a man on a tide came ashore Turk said father and rushed towards him with the Triton it was Poseidon brother thank you in the retrieval of my Triton zues calmly spoke the words this will be the last time any of my children will die at my hands cause u failed to protect your Triton next time it will be war brother.Poseidon spoke understood” zues put zyathien in his arms and took to the sky as Poseidon and Turk took to the sea…
