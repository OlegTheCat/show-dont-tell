No one can imagine how the dream of your life can turned into a nightmare, but sometimes it happens as I’m writing this story it’s a real one that happened to me and I hope to express my words my feelings in my own way.

Dubai – The United Arab Emirates, the place that takes you beyond from the skyscrapers to the fountains and the biggest shopping destinations as well as attractions, actually there’s an image in everyone’s mind about any destination in the world before you visit this country but it is not always the reality it could be just decors like in my story.

The story begins when I accepted a job offer to work as a security officer in the Dubai mall, since I joined I was working hard from my heart , the salary was very low , 6 days a week , bad conditions and the most important thing the people who managing your work.

As it’s a right for anyone in this world to get a driving license to drive a car, but in this company it’s a big deal to write for you what’s so called (NOC) non objection certificate to open a file to get a driving license from a school, they prevent us from getting this one that time I was asking my manager for it.

Then after few months he starts abusing me with the HR to make me stressed and leave, so I decided to leave from fear, you can imagine the feeling in my heart when I left even without my baggage, I was renting a flat there with friends under my name after one month from leaving the check bounced even I informed the real – estate company that I’m leaving but helpless they file a case against me and there’s a debt for a credit card too.

I have my residence still valid, the company where I was working they refuse to let me back to work, I’m tired and exhausted.

God knows,
