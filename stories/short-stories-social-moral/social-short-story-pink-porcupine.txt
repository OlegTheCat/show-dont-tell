Stone, paper, scissor.

“oh shit”, “again you both won. You both club together when we play”.  The girl replied with agitation.

“Even I can say that, you both are siblings”,Ron replied to her sarcastically.

“Children, let’s leave”.

“Ron do you wish to accompany your friends? ”

“No, I am already engaged, you guys enjoy”

(The family left for the carnival)

“Pink ribbons, pink dress, pink shoes, pink lips and now pink candies, pinky”; teased the 8 yr old.

“Moooo…m” cried the 5 yr old sister.

“I don’t fear you pinky ghost, a looser to fall out every discussion. You even lost the last stone paper scissor game” said brother laughing loud.

“I wonder why mom brought a porcupine home, you belong to the tree you were brought from” replied the sister grinning her teeth.

Amidst the fight, mother gave them the title “The pink porcupine, forever and together”.

Both settled at the Giant Wheel after a lot of chaos.

“Stop stop” shouted the pink nose.

“Take a round too high and with great speed” shouted the fun loving porcupine.

The mother standing far glimpsed the peace and love of how her delicate pink rose was being protected by the elder porcupine.

The lovely silence broke down to the disturbing noise of bullets. As the giant wheel stopped the ground broke down to lay thousands dead.

A bullet aimed at the girl was consumed by the boy. The mother exclaimed her last words in disturbing silence “My pink porcupine forever and together”, holding back her dead son and moaning daughter.

Once again,  amidst the innocence and forever love of the pink porcupine terrorism won the game. Scissors and stone won over the innocent paper
