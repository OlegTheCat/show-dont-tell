It is the long awaited moment that the Sun risers Hyderabad won the final match defeating Royal challenger Bangalore by 8 runs in the M. chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore. The most remarkable moment that happens is that Davit Warner came out successful all along and became the hero of IPL T-20 – 2016 matches played for a pretty long period i.e. 58 days continuously amongst 8 teams.

 It is Davit Warner who took decision to bat first after winning the toss. He proved that he had taken the right decision in electing to bat.

 It is Davit Warner that he played excellently with smile and with ease and bated bravely to 69 runs in 38 balls only. When he was bowled by Arvind and caught by Abdulla SRH was 125 for 3 after the dismissal of Shikhar Dhawan at 28 runs in 25 balls and Henriques at 4 runs in 5 balls.

 It is David Warner that left the crease but with firm determination that his will win the match ultimately. Though he was out of the field but he had sheer trust in the ability of his players that they would leave no stone unturned in batting, bowling and fielding and will stop before chasing the target of 209 runs.

 He set the batsmen with free hand one after another on their dismissal – Hooda was out at 3 runs in 6 balls when SRH was 147/4, Yuvraj 38 in 22 balls when SRH was 148/5, Naman Ojha 4 runs in 5 balls when SRH was at 158/6, Bipul Sharma was caught when SRH was 174/7. B. Kumar came and was associated with Cutting who was already set on the crease. B. Kumar preferred to remain on the non batting end to allow Cutting to make runs as many as he could. Cutting made amazingly 39 runs in 14 balls only whereas B. Kumar 1 run in 1 ball.

 It is David Warner who gave free hand to bat boldly and for this he encouraged and inspired to fight vigorously till remains on the cease the result of which he could lead the team to the unexpected grand (grate) total of 208 runs.

 The statistics of the grand total that arrived at in two overs one ball after another can show how bravely Cutting batted to take the total of 208 runs. When the first ball of 18th. over started SRH was at 168/6.

 1. First ball 169/6 (Single run made)

 2. 170/6 (Single run taken)

 3. 174/6 (4 runs)

 4. Bipul Sharma was caught and dismissed.

 5. 179/7 (4 runs made)

 6. 183/7 (4 runs made)

 7. 188/7 (2 runs made)

 8. 194/7 ( 6 runs made) Cutting was at 26 runs in 12 balls

 9. 200/7 ( 6 runs made) Cutting was at 32 runs in 13 balls

 10. 201/7 ( 1 run made)

 11. 202/7 ( 1 run made) Cutting was 33 runs in 14 balls

 12. 208/7 ( 6 runs made) Cutting made 39 runs.

 It is Davit warner who gave warm hands to all the players who played efficiently, effectively and unitedly with only one objective to win the final match and made a remarkable history on record.

 It is David Warner who entered the field with firm determination along with his team and played with one and all shoulder to shoulder with team spirit. He set examples for others how to be vigilant and alert himself as a good fielder and as good captain. He thanked by clapping hands who exerted his most to save runs vigorously, to catch the balls confidently and the last but not the least worked very hard to take the team to victory.

 It is Davit Warner who led the SRH team to the height of success wholly, solely and exclusively by his able captaincy but with generosity.

 It is David Warner who will be remembered by not only the cricket loving people but by all sportsmen also.

 I as a fan to him and as an intimate associate do congratulate him on his grand victory and wish him all success in this popular play in the years to come!
