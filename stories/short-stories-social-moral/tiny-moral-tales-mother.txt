1.

A heartbreak..

 Failed in her favourite subject of dentistry

 Diagnosed with cancer..

Failed suicide attempt..

 Her mother never lost hopes

 10 years later…

 “My mom is the best dental surgeon” ,said her 7 year old proudly …

looking back ..past 10 years ,she felt proud of herself that continuing with dentistry was her best decision ..and it was her mom’s support ..her dream , her belief ,that she had this name in the field of dentistry

2.

 Tears roll down making their way towards the family picture…

 Lonely mother eagerly waits for her birthday surprise

 This time the delivery boy was her son standing at the door in his dad’s favourite blazer and shoes

She was never so happy before, his presence on that special day was the best gift she received on her birthday ..and that smile on his mothers face made everything worth it

3.

11th july- it was her 23’rd birthday

Results out ..she stood first in the class

“Finally a Dentist” ,her timeline displayed

“Choose one ,either me or your career”,he exclaimed

Dentistry was never an option for her

Tears in her eyes,Scars over her soul..

not physically but she was harrassed mentally since past 4 years

Words hurt more than actions do ..

“I am done with you then!” , he yelled

FREEDOM… the best birthday gift she got soo far..

and within 6 years

there she was , a famous dental surgeon ..

4.

No diya’s could compare that brightness on the face of those physically handicapped special creatures of God

 Away from home,The Orphans celebrated their best diwali soo far.

Crackers, diyas ,sweets, chocolates ,and the most important .. spending time with them on this special occasion made it most special one for them.

And that eternal peace and happiness which that couple felt celebrating their first diwali at the orphanage was priceless.
