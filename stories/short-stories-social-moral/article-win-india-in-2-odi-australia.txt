 I watched the match from beginning to the end and enjoyed it and when I noticed a tri- color flag in the hands of the boys, I recollected my own days when winning the match and coming in squad expressing our joy with:

 “ हिन्द का नारा गूंज उठा , जब हाथों में तिरंगा थाम लिया | ”

 “ The slogan of India echoed, when we held up the tri- color flag in our hands.”
