I am trying to find something else…

 The people think and act is not same for always, because they think good but do selfishness “When entering selfishness into action, it’s not good to society”

Why we do to that? Because we are human. So first “We think good but do only when good for our self” we know it’s not good but everyone has some reason that most of the reason only blaming others. When we try to blame to other, we lost our identity. But people not care about it. Still, I am not finding out How to do people wrong thing? and

When people met failure it does not try to find out their mistake. It’s trying to “find anyone to blame for our failure”. It’s not good habit some people expose their feeling, some people not and very few people can realize their mistake on time.

We are human, we live in society. But what mean by society only certain type people can live the best life, some people suffer to run day to day life and some live to cheat another one. This not society. I think it thinks well know everyone but why still it’s not changed? Because of our selfishness! “We do not try to change our self, always we expect when society will change” Society not a Separate element. We are society. So changes it begins with our self only.

Our world now goes very dangerous way. It’s already much time make “wake up call” but we hear but no response. We will lose our time to live world but we don’t much care about it. We do not think about our future generation. The surprise news we know about future happen and we will try to make a solution but we not do. Because of our Selfishness.

Our original Identity is Love.”When we forget to Love to each other that day we lose our identity” Already its progress on…

Why don’t we react?

Still, I am trying to Find something else….
