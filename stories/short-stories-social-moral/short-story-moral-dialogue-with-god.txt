Short Story Moral – Dialogue with God

Ram was sound in his sleep, when he heard the most sublime, sweet voice, calling him over. Ram slowly opened his eyes, he was not sure if he was sleeping or awake but he saw a flash of light in the room. He was not afraid of the light, he was not horrified nor was he shaken to see this light, but he was tempted to reach out to this light.

Ram put his hand in the light and he felt very gentle and suddenly very light as if years of toil and insurmountable problems have simply vanished and then his ear’s heard the most sweet voice,

“My child why are you so worried, I am there to take care of you. I love you and will always make your path laden with flowers. But do not expect me to move thorns out of your way all by myself, you have to make the effort to remove them.”

Suddenly Ram was aghast as if he has seen a ghost, he felt as if the cloak of pseudo happiness has blown away and he has come face to face with his inner self. Ram taking courage asked,

“God, I get what I wish for but I do not have the wisdom of wishing. So I wish no further.”

“My child, it’s  your soul that decides so you need to be in constant dialogue with your soul and not me. I am in the soul, so talk to your soul.”

The alarm clock rang and Ram was jolted out of his dream and he was confused. What was it that he just saw ? Or was it not real ? Was this his soul talking to him, but he learnt the valuable insight that inner dialogue is more important than anything else in life.
