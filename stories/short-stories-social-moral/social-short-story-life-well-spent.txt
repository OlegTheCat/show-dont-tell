Social Short Story – A life well spent

As he moved forward,the streets chewed his legs like gum on pavement. The water filled his shoes, the dirt ate the color away. He entered the abandoned road for love, disguise always excited him. Withdrawn and yet not so distant. His search for something unusual like himself led him forward. He kept looking everywhere for it but all he found was some stones and a parchment wrapped tightly. His eyes shining with curiosity opened the dampened paper.

The winds were surreal raindrops were dripping from his forehead. The sky was black with clouds. He opened it and found a broken pen inside and the words  slightly visible with half blind sight he read

“I see you, and I know you”.

With a sigh he moved forward and calmly sat down on the pavement. Breathing his last thoughts for the winds sang the last song for the man who in search of peace found the war which ached every humans heart. For every one thought they saw you and they knew you.

The war does not end here.You heard me right.The little boy who once used that pencil to sharpen his thoughts is now the old man lost for words. The old man was never retired for words but he failed to speak for the correct time always offended him. The smile on his face now showed no regret, for he had found his sight and his sorrow, he had finally seen himself and known well that one day everyone will know who they see and who they are.

So long son you will write your destiny in madness and zest.Then you will reverse it,twist it,turn it,and finally sanely live it but never forget.it came like a dream.it will leave like one too.

Today is the last day of my dream.For today i hear myself sing my last song for my last life.

As i grow old and see myself in the mirror.I do not see myself i see a climax of a life well spent and not lived.
