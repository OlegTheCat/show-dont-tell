I know that may be you are thinking about the title of my article. Some get understand and some are still thinking that there is no link between funniest and loneliest people. But I know that there will be at least one of your friend or a known person is definitely from this category.

Do you ever notice any of your friend who laugh too much whatever the condition is and never control even sometime in some serious matters like at the  day of the the result of your that subject which you hate too much and your test was also very bad and you got a slap from your teacher and suddenly your friend start laughing and then what? He will also get a thundering slap from teacher to laugh on you…but do you know? The person who laugh in any condition,always laugh internally by all his heart.

And they laugh like that because they want to make themselves happy and and try to make up their mind that everything is fine. Actually they are the loneliest person they have no one to express all his feelings whenever he is happy,sad or angry on anyone. They have no one to tell that what’s going in his mind.

No one like to live alone because they got betray from anyone again and again, so they try to live alone and get happiness from everything. Not only himself ,he make everyone happy and known as most funny guy but actually he is alone and don’t want that everyone will also be like him and try to make everyone happy. Mostly they love to write their feelings and they are the person who not only listen music but also feel and understand the words of a singer because they listen it just not to enjoy also because they can feel it more than the other can.

I know that if you read it completely then you will also try to notice someone like this…

Thanks for reading
