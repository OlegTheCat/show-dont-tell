Patrick Modiano. Who is this mysterious man who has suddenly grabbed the limelight? Do we know him? This less recognised face behind the curtains has suddenly sprung up and collected the most coveted Nobel prize, disheartening the other nominees and fellow writers.

Horace Engdahl had once said,” The purpose of the Nobel prize is to make people famous, not to knock them when they are famous. ”

Patrick Modiano is the 2014 Nobel prize winner for literature. His soulful works as a writer mainly stemmed from the complexities of his childhood.  His father was an Italian jew who did not wear the yellow star and refused to turn himself in for deportation to the Nazi concentration camps. He instead came closer to the Gestapo and joined the organised crime gangs.

Writing was a part and parcel of Modiano’s life. Through his writings which dig deeper into the dark side of his soul, Modiano chose to remain a mystery to his readers. On the other hand, he as well shunned publicity and media limelight.

 Writing, for him, was not something that made him content, but was more of a burden from which he could not set himself free.

His stories usually deal about the Nazi occupation of France. He was, in a way, obsessed by the Occupation and constantly kept coming back to it. The Committee was significantly very impressed by his determination to throw some light at all the figures who were lost in those years.

The subject of the Nazis and the merciless sufferings of the Jews is one that still brings goosebumps. It has always been regretted on the pages of history and are a milestone of the Nazi domination. Patrick Modiamo, the brilliant writer of sufferings has added to the literature and benefited it. His writings are a treasure will be well applauded for centuries to come.
