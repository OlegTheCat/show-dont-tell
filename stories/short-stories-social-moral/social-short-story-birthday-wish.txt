Birthday Wish – Social Short Story

 from 

She was used to giving all of her life. She had given her childhood to her parents, her wishes for her sibling, her fun for her cousins, her gifts for her friends, everything! And it was not forced in anyways, she liked to do it.

Even when she grew up, she had given up her  college fun for her parents, her love, for the sake, yes! her parents….. the list could go on and on. Sometimes they were small things, but which gave her immense joy, sometimes they were just wishes which could have been fulfilled had they not been given up by her.

When she got married she had given up herself, not only physically but her whole being. She no longer was the person, she was drastically changed… but she still had given up herself fully knowing the consequences, or so she thought.

When she had children, it was like rebirth, like everyone said, but unconsciously she had again given a part of herself which could never be gained. But she could see them grow and try to nurture! And get something of something which she had given up….that’s what she thought.

But somewhere she always felt that she was also entitled to get back whatever she had given , sometime or the other , in some form ……Sometimes she used to think back all the things which have gone past her, which could have been hers, if , only if , she hadn’t given up.

Was it worth? No, she thought, otherwise I wouldn’t be thinking about all this in the first place . Yes, nothing was worth except her children. Yes! Maybe it was all meant to be like this , she thought.

Well, I wish someone, no, I mean everyone at least wish me on my birthday!

And I want present too!!
