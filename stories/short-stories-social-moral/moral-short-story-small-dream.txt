My name is Naina and I live with my parents in small village in Bihar. I use to wake up in early morning and work   daily in home. My parents are not capable to send me school due to lack of money.I am full with my desire to do something for me and my family. I used to everyday visit school and see children to study from window but I did not have the courage to get inside the class and learn English, Hindi, science etc.

One day I was returning from the river bank to my home, it was around 6:30 pm. I saw 5 car with police van came across in front of me. One lady came down from the car with security guard. I never saw in my life such type of confidence in any person with great personality and passion in her eyes.

I came near to this lady ask one question “ma’am, Who are you”.

The lady see that girl’s eyes, it was sparkling with tears and dream of desire to do miracle. This lady said” I am an IAS officer and visited your village to see schools operations.”

Naina: “Ma’am I want to become an IAS officer. Please let me know How I can become.”

Lady: You need to study and work hard. Do to you go to school?

Naina: Yes, I go every day but I can’t get attend class because my father cannot afford school fees.

Lady: Don’t Worry, I will help you. I will make an admission in your school and you can earn scholarship for further studies.

Naina got admitted in school and she earned good marks and top in the village and went to city for further studies.

After 24 years she qualified an IAS exam and became IAS officer as district collector in Bihar and visited in village with same way with security guard.

When she arrived in same village, She saw one girl looking her and went near to that girl but that girl was disappeared because, It was the small dream of that girl.
