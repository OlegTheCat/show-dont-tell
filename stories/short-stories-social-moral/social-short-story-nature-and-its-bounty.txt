The other day I was sitting at leisure.

I saw a huge guava tree being chopped down. It was a big tree with its branches spread far and wide. As it was being axed, I heard loud shrills of sound.I ran outside to see as to what was the hue and cry about. To my amazement it was the screaming of children of a nearby poor school. These children were screaming because they didn’t want the big and old fruitful tree to be chopped.

The reason was that whenever raw green guavas turned red and ripe some of them used to fall off from the tree into the by lanes through which these children rushed home. While returning home from school if these children saw any of those guava lying they used to run to get hold of them. Even though these guavas were not owned by the parent of any of the child it found its way into the stomach of an hungry kid. It is a thing to be pondered upon.

We try to give everything to our children as parents weather rich or poor. We tend to go into a shallow when we think…. what will happen to our children if we are not there. Who will take care of them. Who will feed them…….

The answer is Nature.

It is the one who provides for every ones need. It is the one who is nearest to us. It has created us all with blood same in colour. There is none who can keep a morsel of grain more than what is destined for him/her.

 Every deed good or bad is returned within a certain period of time.

 Oh.My beautiful Nature

 I love you the most.

 Because it is you

 Who has stood with me

 Very next like my mother

 Showing me the way of life

 Helping me tread my path

 With you I began and

 In your comfortable lap

 Shall I reach my end.
