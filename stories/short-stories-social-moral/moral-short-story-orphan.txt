“found the money”,said the girl. Who was sitting just beside a dustbin, not in search of food but to find something for someone. Few moments ago an old lady has lost her money; a note of Rs10, almost torn. But that little denomination meant a lot for her, her sad face made the girl notice her worry. The girl started searching the money for her and found the money atlast. She was about to return the money to the lady,suddenly…….

“Get up leena,Its almost 6am”, said Mr Anil. Leena suddenly woke up as she was almost an hour late from her general routine. She can still remember her dream and was feeling a bit sad as she was unable to return that money,although she knew that was a dream. Leena was a  girl of age 12, goes to school, plays with other girls and does  same works  as a common girl of that age do,but still she was not a common girl.

Her mother and father left her since her birth, just due to the fact that she was a girl. An orphanage took care of her since her birth. Mr Anil was the caretaker of that orphanage. Being such a little child she holds many responsibilities as well as duties, which never seems to be done for such a small girl. After her school gets over,she teaches others in orphanage. She was intelligent,helpful and always made others happy with her actions,but deep inside her heart remains a question,”Why other thinks that Being a girl is curse?”.

But her question never let her down, instead it made her more responsible and strong. She wanted to change the word “Curse”  to “Blessing”, but for this she never thought of being an highly professional woman or a millionare in life, instead she tried to teach the orphans of her orphanage about the value of girls.

Leena is still working somewhere and she is now 15, and someday she will find her real destiny and will really change those words,which mean a lot.
