This is the story of a girl who decides to work , beyond her profession for her livelihood but nobody understands her. But everybody liked her, when she got succeeded in her plan.

Vaishali was a college going girl who was doing B.Ed because her parents wanted to make her a school teacher. But she was taking the training of Karate to her safety which couldn’t be liked in her family because nobody wants to train the girls in Karate,except self-defense.

Vaishali got Black Belt in Karate.After the completion of her studies, she began to search a job in school. But the problem of unemployment is increasing day-by-day due to rise in population and a lot of professional manpower is suffering. She got harressed because she had no reference which is required for job and she was very less salary in some private schools (Private Schools are famous for extracting a big amount from parents in the form of fees, and giving low salary to employees).

One day, Vaishali decided to open the Karate school by taking rented place, instead of searching job here-and -there. But everyone in her family began to protest her because nobody wants such type of profession for the girls of the family.

Vaishali said ” I am opening Karate classes by my own savings. If I will fail, then I will stop my business.” She started her business by rented place with the help of her college time junior who agreed to learn Karate from her because she knew about her.

With the passage of time, Vaishali got suceeded in her business and earned a lot of money for her livelihood.

Now the questions arise : – Was her decision right or wrong? Can’t we choose business, instead of doing job and kept ourself self-employed due to competitive market of jobs? Can’t we got suceeded in any other field, without our famous profession?
