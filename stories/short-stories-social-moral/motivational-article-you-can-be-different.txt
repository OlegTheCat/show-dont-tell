Looking at the world today,I see things, heard words and perceived feelings, everybody wants to be at the top, everybody wants to be heard, seen and respected. But I say you can be different.

We are in a world were the common trend is “if you don’t dress to kill, if you don’t expose half of your body, you aren’t sent enough and can’t be recognised in the society.

I remember my childhood days, the uncultured girl, the girl that does not talk, the girl that commit grammatical blunders, very bad in all aspects of English, not good in anything, sloppy in nature and very boring, but today, I am in higher institution studying English, making impact, building my future, building my empire, making a difference in my family, from the low shy girl girl, I became the respected young lady.

In my family, my father respected my words and seek my advice on issues that bothers him, my friends look up to me for advice and guidance, my siblings rate me high with motherly aspirations. Reading books, seeking for knowledge changed my view about life and people, it helps me to know how to relate and live with people without engaging in combat with them, it help me to understand more about life and the human nature. It is true that knowledge is power and it empower those that possess it. Before I developed the habit of reading inspirational and motivational books, I do think like a child but now I think like an adult that has responsibility, that has duties to perform, life and destiny to change.

You can also be different if you are ready to take a step, make a decision to be different, don’t you allow anybody to decide what your future will be like, don’t let anybody draw the map of your life for you. Decide today, take a step to make a change and to make impact in your world. Think BIG AND BE DIFFERENT! I want to be different, I want to make impact in my world and in the society at large.
