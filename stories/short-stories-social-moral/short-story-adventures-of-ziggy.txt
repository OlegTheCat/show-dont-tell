In a land full of energy, there was a little spirit that lived it all. We’ll only refer to this spirit as Ziggy. He lived over a hundred lives, from a fish in the ocean to a man on land. His last form was that of a elephant, but wishes he was something he has not been before. He wanted to be a mighty bear in the woods.

All the other spirit’s he knew had been bears except him. Every time he was a human he was a weak man. When he was a elk, he was hunted down. As a pig, he was nothing more than a meal.  What can be so different about a bear? Ziggy as another past life was hunted down by a bear when he was a bass. He was chased down as a deer. Lastly as a human he was a bear protector and and watcher. He knew that to be a bear he was destined for it. The time has come for a spirit to become a bear, so Ziggy was reincarnated as a bear next.

As a bear Ziggy hunted, climbed trees and fished for bass. He was finally the form he wanted to be. Tell the day he parted away from the others was the same fate he always choose, to be alone. When he was alone he felt weak and scared even as a bear. He thought as a bear he would not need help, but he finally analyzed his past mistakes.

Every time he had died or had been slain he was alone. The spirit finally learned the only reason he wanted to be a bear was to be more powerful so he won’t feel weak. Ziggy did not want to be a lonely spirit no more. His time being a bear was over. He cannot wait to see what he will be next as he learned that being that alone is not a way to live.
