Bias the Art of Favouritism

Culturally, Geographically, Worldly…. somewhere we come across this partiality this bias, which sometimes we just live with. We always think of  but who has the time. It happens with everyone, felt by everyone, and put aside by everyone.

In India its common fact that male child are looked as treasures of the family. But its true with time and date things have improved in the elite section of the society. But the bias still remains. Earlier it was like, son 80 % liked by parents daughter 20%. Now maybe 55-45% close. In rural parts I can only pity.

In schools, colleges, universities we have the favourite student. Alas I was one too. But what about the non-favourite ones?How do they feel?

Then we have the favourite employee, the favourite daughter in law, the list is endless. But I think there will be no end to it as we are all humans.

We have something somewhere which is surely our favourite. Moving on with my dialogue on bias. Do we ever stop by and think the consequences of this bias on people. If only we treated both male and female child as equal. We could have well educated individuals and of course responsible. If only there were no favourites in the household, then no back biting no grudges. Then I guess no teleserials. If only we had equality of gender at work we could have generated so much revenue and shied down other economies.

But as in life where good and bad co exist. So the art of favouritism will always be there. Even if we think of reducing it. We would be trying to capture air in our palms. But human thought process has changed over the years. I generations to come may have different outlook.

But before I end this dialogue. I suggest how many of you can list out your favourite things and favourite people. And those which are not and of course those who are not. And think why so?

I guess its just a domino effect. One treats other as other treats one.
