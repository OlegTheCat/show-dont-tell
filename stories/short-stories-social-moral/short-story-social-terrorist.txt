 from 

She was in the train, going to reach to her dreams. Her dreams of completing her studies. Her father’s advice was still in her ears – go daughter, grow and become big. As the train was gaining speed she went into flashback of her life.

She is born into a middle class family. The only daughter to her parents. She lost her mother when she was just 6 years of age. Her father became her mother since then.

She completed her intermediate from the most prestigious school of her village and her father wanted her to make a doctor. Her father told her that the only way to serve humanity is to give what you can to the humanity. Helping never ends, never dies. Do something great in life before you die. She herself wanted to help humanity. She wanted to become a doctor and she knew there is no university in her town which can give her proper education to become a doctor.

For this, she will have to go the town . She will have to stay away from her father till she becomes a doctor. She agreed and her father agreed as well and suddenly she came out of her thoughts. The train halted at a station. It was a small halt of 2 minutes. A Young man of her same age entered into her compartment and sat opposite to her. He was charming and smart.

She became friendly with her. He told her that he is going to town with a special MOTIVE. But he didn’t revealed what his motive was.

Finally the town came and they both were about to de board.  Suddenly the girl noticed that the guy has left his bag on the seat where he was sitting. She wanted to catch the guy but he was already at the station and was walking faster. The girl yelled his name – and suddenly there was a blast in the train, which destroyed everything. The girl, her dreams, her father’s dreams and many other dreams. Yes that guy was a terrorist and his MOTIVE was Terrorism.
