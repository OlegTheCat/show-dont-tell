Funny Short Story – HOW I TRICKED A TRICKSTER

Funny Short Story – HOW I TRICKED A TRICKSTER

IT WAS 4.30 a.m and I was just opening my eyes due to the cacophony of the alarm buzzing near my ear. I slowly got down from my upper berth of the AC 3-tier and went to check my luggage. The train was scheduled to reach Bhubaneswar at 5 am. I had been away for nearly two years from my home town and was eager to see the place, visit my parents, cousins and friends.

Wasting no more time, I arranged my bags neatly and went near the wash basing to wash my face and brush my teeth. The train was 10 minutes late. I got off and was walking with my luggage when a person asked me in Hindi If I wanted to hire an auto rickshaw. I agreed instantly. He asked me where I wanted to go. I replied “near ITER College.”

I got into the auto and did not realize for a while that it was heading in the wrong direction.

I kept quiet. The driver stopped near a petrol pump and asked me in Hindi for Rs.100.

I handed him the money and slowly understood the game. He considered me a non-Odia because of my fluency in Hindi and also because I was going near ITER College where many students from outside the states studied.

When I reached near my house, I picked up my bags and walked off without giving any more money. He called after me and asked for more money in Hindi.

I could not control my laughter. I told him “Bhaina, ete bulei bulei aniba kana darker thila”. (in odia i said him,what was the need for riding around the longest route to my house)

He was dumb-struck and left immediately without saying a word. I was left laughing and laughing.
