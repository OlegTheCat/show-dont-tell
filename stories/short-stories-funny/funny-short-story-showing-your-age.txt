As a child Rahul had severe mental illness called OCD. but now with the help of his supportive family members and treating team of Bangalore based NIMHANS  he walks free from the shackles of mental illness. However, despite doing his Masters in History from IGNOU in Kolkata he is yet to get a suitable job and is unemployed.

Last month his father expired and the family which exhausted a great amount of economic resources for Rahul’s treatment came to a standstill as his father’s pension stopped. Meanwhile Rahul continued trying his hand at creative writing. One of his favorite pastimes is to write letters to the editors of renowned newspapers.

On 17

 of Feb, 2013 just a day after his mother’s birthday Rahul went to check his inbox and a news made his day. A mail came from London that Rahul had been declared first in the Best Letter To The Editor in Gaurdian in the last month’s competition. He got money worth 2,500 Pounds. He quickly called his mother.

Now his mother Ramaladevi was quite irritated with her son’s irrelevant letter writing to the editors and thought this one something similar. But it was different this time. When she saw the news she hugged and kissed Rahul. Tears of happiness were coming down her cheeks like a cascade.

Quickly she searched the Gaurdain Website in Google to see the content of letter. The letter was written about praising the current Gujarat CM Narendra Modi for his role in the state’s development and his changed stance on the minorities. Rahul’s mother read the whole letter with great enthusiasm. But when she came to the portion where it was written that Rahul was in college during the Godhra Carnage she turned around and told Rahul a bit sternly,

“son you wrote that you were in college in 2002 and today in 2013 you are still searching for  a job. Was it necessary to clarify your age?’

Rahul fumbled and could not utter a single word.
