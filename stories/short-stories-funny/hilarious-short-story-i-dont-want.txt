 “Why you need a girl to marry?”

 “ I want to have a buffalo.”

 “Why a buffalo, you can have milk in the market.”

 “Her horns are sharp. I am afraid she may kill me.”

 “Can a buffalo kill?”

 “Why not, she can kill.”

 “You are safe. She did not kill you.”

 “Of course, but all the days are not alike.”

 “What do mean?”

 “I don’t take your buffalo.”

 “How you know, your buffalo is not dangerous?”

 “I will take a buffalo that is safe.”

 “Safe buffalo, how can you know that?”

 “I will choose a buffalo with no horns.”

 “You are a fool.”

 “Why, I am clever in this matter.”

“No, you are a fool.”

 “Tell me how you say that?”
