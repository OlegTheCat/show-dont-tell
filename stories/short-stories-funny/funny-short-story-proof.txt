“I have the proof sir”

‘What is it?”

“The active proof that is like a moving action you can see in a movie.”

“Very good, now show us the proof.”

“How can I show you? It is not possible.”

“Why it is not possible. When it is true, you can show us the truth. We are here to see the truth and decide.”

“But… impossible.”

“Impossible? Why?”

“You don’t have the permission. You cannot see which is saved here.”

“You are speaking nonsense. We have legal permission to see any saved truth. We have that right.”

“Sir, I know you should not be denied. But you are denied.”

“Why? Why?”

“Because my eyes allow me only to see what I saw. It’s not possible for your eyes to see that with your legal permission.”

“Bring another proof that is not saved in your eyes. Till then, the incident is not done.”

“I have the proof sir”

‘What is it?”

“The active proof that is like a moving action you can see like a movie many times.”

“Very good, now show us the proof.”

“How can I show you? It is not possible.”

“Why it is not possible. When it is true, you can show us the truth. We are here to see the truth and decide.”

“But… impossible.”

“Impossible? Why?”

“You don’t have the permission.”

“What nonsense you are speaking. We have the legal permission to see any saved truth. We have that right.”

“I know that what you are speaking right Sir, It cannot be denied. But you are denied.”

“Denied? Who? Who are they?”

“They stole my memory card that I shot. So the live proof is now in some unknown hands who do not allow you to see that. They denied permission to you sir.”

“Who are they?”

“I don’t know sir as you don’t know. So I cannot say.”

“Bring the proof. Till then, the incident is not done.”

“We don’t have the chance.”

“What chance… nonsense… We have the legal permission to see any truth. We have that right.”

“I know that what you are speaking right Sir, It cannot be denied. But we have no chance. We are denied”

“Denied? Who? Who are they? How we are denied???”

“They stole my Lamb sir. It is like my breath. I heard that they ate it last night. If it is live, it run to me saying “May… May…” but as it is killed and eaten, we are denied of the proof that they are killers.”

“Who do you come here without a proof in your hands?”

“I don’t know sir. Now I know that you are proof masters.”

“Good. Bring the proof. Till then, the incident is not done.”
