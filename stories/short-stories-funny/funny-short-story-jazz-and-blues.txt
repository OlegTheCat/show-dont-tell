Louie said ” yesterday i was at the movies too.. it was a western. hero comes out on a horse in a desert with so 

music and his clothes are all torn up, he has all blood over his body with all bullet holes and there is so much dust because of the wind. The hero was dying . he was crying so loud with pain.The scene was so
