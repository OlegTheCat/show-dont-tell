“You must stop this…”

He knew he had to finish the story. Intoxication is supposed to be an exhilarating experience. He knew this feeling existed. After all he had just downed two full johnny walkers.

There were people milling around him in the internet, all asking him to stop it and put them out of their misery of having to read another one of his dreadful short stories.

But nothing could stop him now. He had witnessed glimpses of perfection. Specifically, at https://yourstoryclub.com/short-stories-social-moral/short-story-the-creators-demise/, an editors choice. It had the beauty, the grace, the valor, the language, the grammar, the spelling and as a topping to the cake – wait for it – no typo! He was amazed. He had to reproduce it in its glory. He downloaded the entire story, opened it in word and started substituting words for their synonyms.

He had first seen it while absent minded and dismissed it as another awful Editor’s choice. But then he came back to it. And realized it.

“This is what I am looking for. Man has wrote too much. The word is too ugly for me. The story has nothing and yet it has everything. I must spoof it.”

But every time he tried there was something missing. Maybe a sentence which could easily have been overlooked. His watch stopped working ,ergo time ceased to matter. He needed to spoof it. It would be his masterpiece.He began to smash things around the room. He threw the computer out the window. He opened the door and threw out all his clothes. Despair consumed him. He went outside and set his house on fire. He slit his skin to stay awake. Then he started slitting other’s skin. He then moved on the necks and very soon acquired the name of Jack the Ripper.

Finally he was finished. He read it over and over again and finally saved the draft, previewed it and submitted it for review. He watched day and night for it to appear on the site page. And finally it did. He didn’t move( though he desperately wanted to answer two missed calls nature had given him). He wanted to know what others thought. He waited watched, refreshing the page every now and then. And then finally the first comment appeared :

” Wow man. That is the worst story I’ve read. Awful. What are you, a chimpanzee?”

He went and hanged himself.
