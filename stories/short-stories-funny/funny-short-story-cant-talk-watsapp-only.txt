Samantha’s mobile beeped. The WatsApp message showed, “How was your day, honey?” Samantha smiled. A message from her husband, Raj always lit up her face. “As usual hectic. How was your meeting?”

“Meeting was good. Client liked my presentation.” By the way, was checking your photo on Facebook. Looking hot.”

“Thanks sweetheart. Muuaah baby. Did you have your lunch on time?”

Now it was Raj’s turn to smile. Samantha was always so caring ever since he knew her. Even in the middle of an argument, she would never forget to ask about his meals. “Nope. Had fruits only. But dinner was yummy. How was Ria’s drawing competition?? “

“She is bit upset. Got second prize only but don’t worry, she will be ok by tomorrow morning. Have just sent you a photo of her receiving the trophy.”

“Oh! My poor baby..I will send her some jokes to cheer her up. She looks so lovely in the photo.”

“Listen, have you filed your IT returns?? The last date is nearing. I have filed mine.”

“Ya I know. Have told Rajiv to take care of it. Sweety, I am thinking of investing in Gurgaon property in next two months. What’s your opinion??”

“If you feel it’s a safe bet, go ahead.”

“Ok. I will mail you the details and also the excel sheet in which I have made the calculations of my investment plan. Once you check it, mail me your suggestions.”

“Sure. Darling, can we go for a movie tomorrow and a dinner afterwards. It has been a long time. “

“Fine. What time and which movie??”

“Will check the details and watsapp you by tomorrow evening.”

“Ok. Feeling sleepy now. Have to leave early morning to meet client. See you tomorrow evening at the theatre. Love u loads. Good night.”

“Love u too. Loads of hugs and kisses. Goodnight darling.”

Five minutes afterwards, Samantha’s mobile beeped again. “Honey, please switch off the lights of your side. I am not able to sleep.”
