People believe in gods and so the demons…day represent the truth and the night the reign of the devil..

THE legend has it that parajith a devil was killed by sarvayana the son of the gods and saved the world from destruction and he was then buried in an volcano as he was turning evil from a spell from a poisonous flower..

The legend has it that once a devil named parajith meditated in the jungles of vayavna to achieve enlightenment..he wanted to be a god.he sought many sadhus,priests to learn the trick to attain enlightment. he tortured them and burned them alive . he had this unique power to put fear in peoples mind just by looking them in there eyes..the sadhus chanted the gods versus and he burned them alive and they kept chanting . he waited and saw there bodies melt but there lips still moving in the name of lord.then there was a tantrik who researched years on how to attain enlightenment… he was close…parajit found him and then began the reign of terror..together they were invincible..the evil magic and parajits power created hell on earth..tantrik was called the kalpavijayan…story has it that he was once tied to the trees and was burnt alive for the act of witchcraft by the king…but he somehow vanished in thin air and was never found since..kalpavijayan said to parajit that to attain enlightenment he would firstly need three things ..the root of the crying flower, the hair of a witch and the heart of the purest soul…parajit set out for his search ..

gods had seen this and were helpless..they had a problem that they couldn’t interfere on anything that happens on earth as if they would ever land on earth they would loose the immortality ..the god of the gods was on a deep meditation which no one  can break and it would take 21 years for the completion of his meditation..and there were 2 years left.. the gods couldn’t wake him up..they had to think of something else parajit would attain enlightenment and then there would be no one to stop him destroying the world..lokanay a god of wisdom had a plan…he wanted to create a demi-god a mortal half human..but powers unimaginable..so then began the creation of sarvanaya the son of gods ..they searched for a man who had lost everything , one who was helpless and needy, tired of his life ,one who knows what pain is and one who could fight for others…

on a small hill in the midst of a jungle a man stood , weeping in despair ..he wiped his tears and closed his eyes , he murmured a few words and moved to the edge and just walked and fell from the hill.. after a little while he found himself in the water he was alive and what was more astounding was that he was breathing in water…suddenly something caught his leg and just pulled him deep inside the waters he could just try but in vain..he saw a bright light far away , his eyes glowed and was hypnotized he saw a man with a wooden stick with mermaids around him..he walked towards him and whispered a magical versus and he vanished but what went with him was the soul of the man and new energy was put within him..emerging from the waters he rose up and floated to a shore..when he woke up he felt powerful..he had forgotten who he was..he felt new..sarvayana was born…a glowing leaf floated to the shore and he picked it up and with his touch the leaf just glowed brighter and brighter..and sarvayana went into a trans..he could talk to the gods..and then began the journey of sarvayana in search of parajit with the help of the gods …
