Hi guys! Today I want to tell a story of mine! Based on my real life story. In this universe, almost everyone have their own loving and a favorite person, the same goes to me. I had one . My FATHER!

I was very lucky to met him. He is the best dad ever. He sacrifice a lot of thing in my life. I loved him very much to the core and will always. But, a dark incident happen in my life. I can’t forget that incident until know. It always disturb me and like always as a girl , I will start crying.

Horrible right? Well, I need to go through it. It was the death of my father! How would you feel if u lose the person that you loved the most ?!? So hurting right? He left me on 7 March 2003 , when I was 4 years old. I know that I’m very young that time, but I still know what is going on. And the most hurting and saddest thing ever is seeing your mother crying. She cries and cried a lot.

She never eat or drink anything. What to do? It’s all fate. Well she loved him so much! It’s damn hurting, when they call out my name and ask about my father in my class. In front of my class! Do you know? I’m the only child that don’t have a father in my class? And I will get jealous when they bring their father when parents and teachers meeting day.

What is it called? Report card day? I will be waiting when I can see my father again. But , one thing, as I said to you , he is awesome because he left me the biggest present on earth . Which is my loving, humble and hardworking mummy! She is my idol. She go through a lot of situations and I know she miss my father a lot. Well, I know that he is blessing us and watching us up in the heaven there. When I will see you again daddy? I and mummy really miss you a lot!
