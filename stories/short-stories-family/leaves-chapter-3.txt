Back at the hospital, Mimi required scans. Apparently, things had gotten worse since her last visit. John was lost in thought. Just wandered off into the city. He reached the hospital by foot with Bruno. he begins to walk right in when..

“Sir, please leave the dog outdoors. He will not be allowed to pass any further.”

Only on the nurse’s objection to let Bruno in, did John realize how far he had wandered off. He asks her where he can keep Bruno because he will be in there only for a while. It was difficult to look into John’s eyes and defy him of the very little he ever asks. After some accountable huffing and puffing time, the nurse says to him, “You be glad, this guy’s too cute to abandon.”

“Thank you, little lady. I promise I wont be long.” He said as he rushed in.

She could taste the desperation from his urgency. “I’m only on break for a little while longer, sir.”

She yells through the distance. But he was long gone. A tiny voice was heard amongst all the noise, “Mimi wont let me stay too long before visiting time.”

The nurse grew joyful and begins to chuckle. Murmurs to herself, “So, you are the wonderful John eh?” and then to Bruno, “I guess, my break can be extended for the love of those two. Come on, lets go get you a biscuit.”

John reaches the receiving room. “John? What are you doing here, now?? Visiting time isn’t until 5.” She spoke in her soulful christian voice. He takes a while to catch his breath.

“Yes ma’am, but I need to see her. She’s all I need.” He says to her convincingly.

“Owh, stop that! Call me Rachel. You may go, but don’t tell the others I let you in, yeah?”.

“Others? Let me in? What? You did nothing of that sort, little miss. You have me mistaken for a visitor.” He exits with a wink that made all the difference.
