“Mom” started Kishore.

“Yes darling” said his caring mom.

“My lecturer wants to meet you” he said ashamed.

Kishore gulped. He knew what happens next.

“You stupid.”

“Don’t you have any sense?”

“I am going to your college more than you.”

“How many times i have to say you, read well?”

”Aren’t you ashamed to stand like this in front of me?

She pointed at Kiran.

Kiran was busy researching for his project.

“See Kiran. He was also born to me.”

“Why don’t you see him and study ?”

“You are such a waste. Fit for nothing.”

“I can’t come.”

Mom could not hold her breathe.

She went inside the kitchen.

Kishore looked down. Like a villain. He never liked him being compared to his elder brother.

Kiran was an intelligent student. But Kishore .. well he was just starting to be a student.

Kishore wont leave his mom.

He quietly slid inside the kitchen. Kiran looked at him for 2 sec and resumed his work.

“Mom ……..i did not do anything. This chemistry teacher is pouring equations on my head.”

“How much can a first year student study?”

“You tell.” Kishore justified.

Mom raised her voice.

“He studied the same thing. He never complained.”

Kishore stared at his brother. Kiran was too busy to hear this.

“Final. I can’t come.” finished mom.

Kishore decided he will not talk with mom any more. She just compares.

“ Go. I don’t want anyone. I will deal myself with this chemistry teacher.” he shouted back.

 

—— NEXT DAY —–

“Sir, may i come in?” peon came inside.

“Yes tell” Professor asked quickly.

“Kiran there sir?” he asked.

Kiran who was bugged in his books suddenly raised up.

Professor looked at Kiran and then asked peon.

“Why you want him?”

“Rehman sir called him. His brother is in principal’s office.” peon carelessly.

Kiran looked around. His friends were staring at him. His heart stopped beating.

“OK, come back fast Kiran.” said professor.

“ yes..yes sir” Kiran said in guilt.

He hurried to principal’s room. Kishore was outside waiting for Kiran to come. Kiran walked fast.

He looked at Kishore as he opened principal’s room.

“……… no concentration, no discipline …..Oh Kiran came…. See this young man….” Kishore heard this from outside as door closed.

Half an hour passed. Kishore did not know what was happening inside.

He looked at his fingers. No extra nail to bite.

Door opened.

“….take care of him Kiran” Rehman Sir said and went off .

Kiran came out . He stared at Kishore and said “ Come home i ll see you there.” in anger.

Kishore knew he is gone for today.

“Who told this idiot to go to college?”

“Don’t send him. When the peon came and called my name, I felt so ashamed in front of others”

“I had a good name. He just buried it in the sand deep.”

“Now every one knows i have an brother like this”

“Gone. I don’t how to face others.”

“Why doesn’t he go and die somewhere ?”

“Spoiling my name and fame.”

“Tell him to get out of my sight.”

Kiran was so tensed.

Kishore was biting his teeth so hard.

He did not want to talk . He looked at his mom and said” I told that principal no need to call him and all. He only did not listen. What will ……. … ”

“One word and i ll give you sound thrashing” Kiran rose his hand.

“Stop it Kiran… No” mom interfered.

“Do something mom. I don’t want to see him.” Kiran ended and went to his room.

“See go to him and say sorry , You will read well hereafter and will not cause bad name to him. Say this. I ll watch your back.” mom smoothed.

“Why should i? I did not call him . Why did he come?” Kishore backed up.

“Go i say.” mom pushed him.

Kiran was furious. He was trying to read his 500 page Electronics book. Kishore entered the room.

“I am sorry.”

Kiran raised his eyes in the same position.

“I will read well.”

Kishore looked on the floor.

He was counting the tiles.

“Just forgive him Kiran. He will do well. U see. He will keep up your name. Right Kishore?” mom looked at him.

“Hmm” said Kishore.

Kishore was very angry. He hated his brother in every aspect.

“Leave it man. All brothers are this way.” said Vikram, Kishore’s class mate.

“Why is he always getting the credit man?” Kishore on his 3 rd glass of wine.

“He was born first.”

“He won many prizes.”

“He studies well.”

“He is topper.”

“He looks handsome.”

“He is decent.”

“He is every one’s darling.” lined his friends.

“Are you guys my friends or his?” Kishore shouted in jealous.

“Sorry boss. But there are facts man.” they said.

“Its not fact. Its fate.” Kishore pointed the sky and said.

“May be. So what?” Raj asked.

Kishore drank his 4 Th glass and spoke harshly ” He has everything right. I ll make him nothing. If only he is there he will get. I ll kill that idiot with my hands.” he made crushing gesture with his hands.

“Don’t shout man you mom will come looking for you above..” Vikram said looking at the door.

“I will shout . I will shout at everyone…… Hey Raj come here… come here and stand.”

Kishore was in drunk state.

Raj came and stood.

“Now you are my brother……..OK……. Kiran… I will speak to you…. you should not utter any word…. OK shhhhhh…. mmm” asked Kishore.

“Done man.” whined Raj.

He wanted to give a big start as if he is going to finish off his brother.

He got remained of all the comparisons he had faced all these years. The anger filled his eyes.

He turned back in full force.

“Kishore…” Vikram lowered.

“Shhhhhhhh” Kishore silenced every one.

He could see only one person in front of his eyes… His brother.. Kiran…

“ Hey Kiran.. My Big Brother… How are you feeling….. good??….. happy??….blessed??…..

You must be …i know…. But you know one thing… I AM NOT…

Yes .. i am never happy with you..

You are only seen in god’s eyes…………. Because…… you are born first…… I am last….. I am neglected….

When ever some one compares me with you…. do you know how it feels… Have you been ever compared??…. ever…?? ….

No….Not even once….

Because you are first and i am …..last.. You get all the grace. …. Even mom supports you…

Every one says you are better…….. you ever knew why??

They never noticed me …. you stole all the show.

Its because when i brought the small cup …..you brought the championship cup home…

You stole my glory. …….I was never no one…. even for mom…

Do you really love me……. as a small brother….. no… never… u never wanted me…..

Have you ever thought…… He is my baby brother …… Let him also live better….?? tell??

Let me sacrifice for him . ……. Let his get some name…. mmmm??

Selfish…………. your are soo selfish. You want all for yourself…..

If you get all the name and fame….. What will i get???” Kiran shouted.

“Is this tears? Ohhhhhhh… You know how much tears i have wept all these years..????

All because of you…. Let me also live.. If you are there i can’t…….Final…. I don’t need you….go off.. die…DIE… I will be really very happy…So happy ..I WILL BE THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE WORLD…….. will you die.. Please.. i beg you.. die…”

Kishore begged at his legs and fell down.

 

—– NEXT DAY —–

“Sir, may i come in?” peon came inside.

“Yes tell” Professor asked quickly.

“Kishore there sir?” he asked.

“Not again” Kishore bit his lips.

Professor looked at Kishore and then asked peon.

“Why you want him?”

“Principal is calling him. Some police has come to see him it seems.” peon said silently.

Kishore looked around. His friends were staring at him. His heart stopped beating.

“I swear i did not drink yesterday sir. I did not beat anyone sir. I was in home only. You can ask my mom sir…. Sir” Kishore sweated on seeing the police officer.

The police officer came near and kept his hands on the shoulder.

He removed his cap and said

“Sorry son. Its a bad news.

Your brother Kiran is dead.”

Kishore was speechless.

“What …” he clarified again.

“He was hit by a lorry this morning when he crossed the road. He died on the spot.

I am sorry for your loss. You can go home now.”

First reaction Kishore felt was happy, delighted. He wondered if god heard his words.

“KISHORE …. see what has happened to your brother …..he left us all….. Oh my god…. how can i live with out him??” cried his mom on seeing him home.

There lied Kiran in the coffin . Kishore did not know what reaction to give. But sure ,he was in shock. Every one consoled him and went.

Kishore could not think.

He was the main person now.

Every one called him. He liked that.

A few days passed. Everything came to normal.

Kishore and his friends came up to terrace for a drink.

Vikram said “ I am sorry man. Poor your brother. Every one misses him in the college.”

Raj said “ Yes Kishore. Every professor says in praise of him and only starts the class. I wonder what could have happened.”

“God is there man. He is watching us. He heard me.” Kishore looked up at the sky.

“What did he hear man?” Raj asked surprisingly.

“That only. That day i made you stand as my brother and i spoke right. That one.” Kishore looked down in guilt.

“What are you blabbering man? “ Raj scratched his head.

“Hey did you forget? I called you to stand right here .” Kishore pointed at the floor.

Raj came and stood at the spot.

“You called me to stand here. I came. But you were speaking some thing to your brother. So i came back and sat. Right boys?” Raj clarified.

Vikram added “ Yes man . You were shouting some thing to your brother i think. I did not hear well. I was in the 4 Th round. You slept hugging your brother. We slept off here itself. Wow nice fellow man,your brother .He hugged and kissed you and carried you back to your room. Poor fellow. Death was too soon for him… Kishore.. are you alright?
