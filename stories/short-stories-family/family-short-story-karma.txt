Family Short Story – Karma.

They’re leaving with their first born. This hospital is as gloomy as it gets. There’s a wheel chair involved. But we both sat in it so differently. A couple of days ago, I was put in one too. I was laughing. She was calm, with an infant almost too tiny to breathe, laying there in all delicateness.

I don’t see the point, its a pink ball of flesh. But in their eyes, so much fullness. They already suite their roles in the future of their little ward. There’s this air of pride that clouds him. I personally adore it!

She on the other hand, was just as delicate as her little one. Weak and brittle, barely able to stand. Still, a smile she bore. A very subtle one. Directed straight toward the only things that is most important to her in whole wide world right now, her baby.

Little does she care about the pain he will bare. The very same pain she gave her own. The stages of life that she will relive with the aging of this small guy. The birth, now in a different perspective. She will watch him grow into tiny feet that will raise him up to stand taller than her eventually. His very first fall will make her tremble. She will hold him while he is at it. Soon he will grow tired of falling, he will walk on. On and away from this woman who held him too tight. Pain will seep through her and she will not know it. He will walk away too far and it will be too late when/if he realizes what came over him. For he would have made the same mistakes as she did once. And only realize them when they were done to him by his own.
