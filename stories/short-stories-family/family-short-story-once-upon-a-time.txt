Arif was scrolling down through his facebook time-line. While going through his old posts he stopped suddenly on seeing that post about his father kicking him out of his home. When Arif read those lines on his computer screen a chill went through his whole body.

When Arif was just a boy his father threw him out of the house because he was just a useless boy. He hated going to school and would only create troubles and problems for his family. He never gave a though to it that what will he do without education in this modern world of education and technology. His father knew that if he would throw him out of the house then and only then would he come to know the reality of the world and the necessity of education.

On one Saturday when Arif refused to go to school as always his father kicked him out of the house and Arif was left alone as a homeless wanderer.

Arif was a lucky boy and somehow managed to earn a living and finally became a respectable man. He had gone abroad and settled there permanently.

He took a deep sigh when he finished reading that old post on his computer. Then he scrolled down and started to read the comments on that post. Among those comments there was a comment from his friend who had asked him that was it the rudeness or the kindness of your father that he made you leave your own home? And in the reply Arif had typed the word rudeness a long time ago without thinking much about it. It was some ten years ago.

Arif gazed for a long time at his reply and then clicked the edit word below his reply comment. With tears running down his face he edited the reply by replacing the rudeness word with kindness.
