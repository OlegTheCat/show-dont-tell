This is a story about a girl whose life was cursed from day she was born. Kaveri was born in a middle class family. Her father died long back and she lived with her mother and elder brother. Her mother worked in govt hospital to run the house. Her brother was always rude and bossy towards her.

Since her school was far she had to travel alot. When she got back all tired and hungry she used to do all house chores and eat whatever semi cooked food her mother cooked in haste. She did not have many friends and some that she had , lived far. She felt all alone and nobody cared for her.

Days passed and one day her mother got her married. But ill fate did not leave her. Her husband also was ruthless and never cared for her. She had three kids. Her mother passed away few years after her marriage. Brother got married and never bothered much about his sister. She had no one to turn to and for sake of her three children , carried on with her ill fate.

Time passed , her children got married and got busy in their own lives. Now she had no wish to live. All the years of suffering and stress had weakened her body and mind. She cared less about her health . She suffered with high sugar, weak kidney and heart. Her body could not take any more. Still she never complained and kept doing her duties.

One evening after finishing her daily chores and duties , sitting  all alone quietly to rest her tired body…hands still dirty with dough left after making rotis…thinking to wash them after resting her tired swollen legs…not knowing she would not be able to…she passed away quietly from sudden heart failure…putting an end to her life long ordeal and suffering…
