 

Elisabeth Cain was the wife of john, who was the man with all the power of political aspects and so on. Elisabeth was a housewife and the mother of Shawn Junior Cain the only child they had. Elisabeth complexion was dark,hair goldenly long , short and her eyes light blue. Elisabeth made garments in between but she was never allowed to get a real job. Shawn was fifteen years old and he was home schooled. John and his son were both of white complexion, tall , handsome with brown eyes and hair jet black and straight .

The family seemed so happy living in their mansion which was painted in faded colors which was quite strange and the furniture colors were very odd too. The grass barely seem to grow and the birds only sang dull songs. They hardly had visitors or holidays plan. Elisabeth catered for them both with special dishes of salad, meats of different kinds, soups, vegetables and wines. John never seemed to have time to attend Sunday worship as Elisabeth did. Elisabeth and her son where always nicely dressed. Sally was the head of worship counsel and she would always exchange nice words with Elisabeth .

They both seemed fond of each other that smiles where always shinning. Elisabeth decided to invite sally over for lunch without John’s permission.

‘Are you sure that it won’t be a problem to your husband? asked sally”.

Elisabeth replied ‘its ok’.

Songs were happily sang and bible verses read. As soon as it was all over both Elisabeth , her son walked over with sally to their house. Elisabeth turned the key to open the door and she left everyone in. Her husband caught her by surprise. Elisabeth introduced both sally and john to each other and they all had lunch.
