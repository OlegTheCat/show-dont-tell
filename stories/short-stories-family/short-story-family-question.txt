Family Short Story – THE QUESTION

“Why did he abandon her Appa?” Mayra asked Appa innocently.

It was a rainy Sunday, and the duo was enjoying watching the Indian Epic, Ramayana, when the gullible eight year old raised this question to her Appa (father). Baffled by Mayra’s thoughts he replied “because he was a king and had no other choice my dear. He had to set this example of pure sacrifice before his people”.

“But, Appa, you told that he was a God. And if he was a God then why did he not take a decision that was just for everyone and the rest of the human race?”

Appa frowned as this time he had no answer to her query. That was surely not the first time that something of this sort has happened. Amma was in the kitchen making pakoras for everyone when she heard her little one’s innocent but appropriate question. She had a huge smile over her face when Mayra silenced her Appa unknowingly. She knew that her daughter has grown up in her own reflection.

‘Why did she jump into the fire daddy? Does this mean every woman will have to face this in future?’

Amma’s smile widened when she recalled a similar encounter with her father three decades back. Though, there was a generation gap between the two, but somehow the questions remained the same for both the yonks. Hiding her amusement, Amma broke the awkward silence in the room when she squeaked, “It’s time for the treat people!” and walked into the room with the plate of delicacies in her hands.

Appa made a short sneak out and swapped through the channels making the apt use of the moment. Witnessing this glimpse of his struggle, Amma could no more hold it in and burst out laughing. Mayra looked at her inquisitively whereas Appa joined in.

“Another revolutionist in the house, Professor?”, asked Appa.

“Indeed” replied Amma with the sparkling eyes.
