Trrriiiing! buzz my phone on the new year.  Congratulations, you are preferred for our business. The news spread round my house like a wildfire. I shifted to New York. Everything was great! I had a small house, with a smooth living. I did not face any problems.

I constantly call my mom during new year’s eve, but she was always down in dumps. I could hear the cheerlessness by her utter. Our family is alive with a dozen of heads. We receive gifts from each clans person. My mom gained prodigious tokens each year. But yet she remained the same.

Gifts on New Year became a custom. Next New year too there were gifts for all, but again mother was not delighted with her gift. Five years passed. Everyone was happy but my mother was never, with the gifts that she received. She always appeared to be gloomy, and at night she just counted the stars and stared at the moon.

I decided to plan a jumbo surprise for her. I sent her my gift ,and it reached on the eve. Everyone received their presents in a small box. But, everyone just stared at my mom’s box. It was slightly – actually way bigger than their boxes.

She opened her box. Upon seeing her gift, she was overjoyed. It seemed like, she has got the happiness of whole world.  She was extremely delighted. My family never saw her as delighted. Everyone wondered what was the gift that made my mom overwhelmed.

Finally, my sister in law asked my mom about the premium that she has received.  My mom’s mouth was tongue tied. She could not speak by her happiness. When my sister in law opened the box, she saw a small piece of paper. She unfolded it and read:

Mom, I am coming back home next week.
