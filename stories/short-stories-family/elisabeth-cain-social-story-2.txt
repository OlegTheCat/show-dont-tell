 

As Sally had gone her way. Shawn helped his mother clear the table, Then he went upstairs. John was arguing with Elisabeth about church worshipers and have them entering their home and spreading they false news.

Elisabeth replied john; you never have time for church or god’.john i need to communicate with other people rather than being in this dull and boring place.john response was that he was busy making money and being the provider. I rather believe in the devil instead john said.John raised his hands after the last response.

Elisabeth was in tears then john ripped her clothes off and dragged her to the extra spare room downstairs . He rapped her over and over but nobody could hear her screams. When he was finish he told her to go and clean up. John’s last words to her was if you ever tell ,you won’t live to tell the tale. She was weak and helpless to herself. She couldn’t believe that he had changed into an evil monster.

She went and cleaned up ; then washed the dishes after. She decided to stay in silence while john was playing his music. Thoughts ran through her head and questions too. She had been a honest and faithful wife to him but he didn’t deserve her. S

hawn came back downstairs to get a glass of juice but then he was shocked to see his mother’s face. ‘Mom ,what happened to your face ‘asked Shawn.”

She told him that she had slipped just to keep him from worrying.  She knew that someday that things would change and that she would have to get a better life for her and her son; from been abused. John just looked at her and shook his head. She now knew that love died.
