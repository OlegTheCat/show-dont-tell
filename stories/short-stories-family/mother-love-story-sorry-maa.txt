A couple of days back from now, I received a text from one of my post graduate student, stating:

“Happy Mother’s Day to your Mamma…coz she has given me a lovely teacher like you…love you Ma’am”

It took me a minutes time to figure out that it was Mother’s Day and the day was virtually over where I did not even wish her…I did not remember at all…

I was so filled with culpability not just at the thought of not wishing my Mother on the occasion of Mother’s day, rather to the fact that I do not have time in life for my own mother…

I tried to sit and  ponder that when was the last time I sat with her to talk or to help her in kitchen or to go on for shopping with her or to attend some event…I am yet to receive an answer as for years now my humdrum schedule remains the same …

I just see my mother twice… once while leaving for office and another while taking the meal at night and even there I at times just sit and eat without realizing that she is still in kitchen… my guilt amplified because she has never grumbled, never cribbed onto this fact, never tried to make me realize that I am doing some sort of injustice towards her…

@Niiti : thank you for making me understand and realize that I may be able to accomplish much in years to come but what am I loosing is certainly the most irretrievable loss for me…

This is not something that only I witnessed, rather we all must have at some point or the other…we all are so busy into our lives, achieving targets, settling liabilities, relationship issues, dating, spouse, kids, society, societal pressure that amidst all this we tend to forget the one who brought us here…
