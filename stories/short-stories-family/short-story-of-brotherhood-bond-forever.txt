” You know , I made you! ”

” What rubbish ! who do you think you are? ”

” No, its true . I made you out of me.. I mean from a part of me.”

“heh, heh, heh,…”

” No, really. I was bored , didn’t want to be alone, so I thought what if I make someone just like me! ”

“You expect me to believe that. ”

“You have to believe me , because its the truth . And no one can change this fact”.

“I am getting bored now. I will take a nap , so please stop bothering me”.

” Don’t you love me?”

” What’s that got to do with this ? I would love you even if you didn’t make up this story .”

” You have to believe this . God had given me this power to make you , so that we will be always together.”

“Now this is getting a bit too much of your bragging…. I am getting irritated .”

” I was only two weeks old when I made you “.

” Now whom should I ask if this is true or you would go on and on ?”

” You can ask Mom since we would be seeing her in some days”.

“Really? we will be seeing mom ? Yipeeee!!”

” Yeah, though I made you , you are the one who is going to come out first .. my older brother !

 

Epilogue-  They  finally did get to see their mom, not after few days as was supposed to be , but the very next day! The younger one, ( older brother to the world ) was so excited at the prospect to see mom, that he turned and twisted, stood head over heels, and manoeuvred such that he was out the next day! His brother had to follow him. He didn’t have any choice. So they not only saw mom, but also dad, and a multitude of faces over the next few days, that the older one said , it was enough! He wanted  a break ! The younger brother pacified him, and was always  there to guide him and support him . He knew he would be doing that through  their whole  life, you see, only he knew that he was the older brother! or maybe mom knew too….
