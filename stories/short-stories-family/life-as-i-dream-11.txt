A year Later…..

I was waiting for an interview. I joined a new MNC recently & this is the interview for a project. I have cleared the first round & hopefully this should be the final one.

Interviewer called me inside his cabin & introduced himself as Ravi.

“So where did you do your MBA from?” He asked me after looking at my resume.

“NIT Trichy”

“Oh NIT offers MBA course? Haven’t heard of it”

“Yes. Infact the department is in existence for last thirty years.” 

“Mm okay….Let’s talk about your project experience…”

We talk in length regarding my project experience.

“Actually we want someone who needs to be at onsite. Are you okay for it?”

“Yes that should not be problem?”

“Sure. How about long-term?”

“I’m quite okay…”

“Are you married or single?”

“Neither. I’m a divorcee.”

“Oh, I’m sorry. Let me give a brief background about the project”

He talks about the project & about himself. He has done his engineering from IIT and MBA from IIM. No wonder he didn’t recognize NIT.

“Okay Sandya. I will discuss with my manager and call you shortly.”

“Okay. Thank you.”

I was in cafeteria sipping a coffee and waiting for results. My thoughts wandered somewhere.

Why me of all people is in this situation..People see me as a failure, as a person who has lost everything. Despite the repeated attempts from me, there was no budge from Vineeth’s stand. He kept on saying “I’m happy in this marriage & if you respect the elders you will also feel happy”. I took him to marriage counseling but he walked out of counseling after few sessions saying it’s useless. Marriage counselor asked me to go back to Vineeth’s place & fight back. But Vineeth wanted not only me back…He wanted a kid immediately, as his mother thinks there will be more bonding between us when we are a family. I felt it’s wrong to bring another individual to this unhappy marriage. I couldn’t either leave Vineeth or agree for a kid. I decided to wait.

I waited to hear something from Vineeth. But his mom came met my parents. Literally forced me to come back with his conditions or agree for a divorce. I spoke with Vineeth…the wait of months hasn’t changed his position. He still couldn’t understand why I did, what I did. I spoke to his father…he said he couldn’t change Vineeth’s mind. In the end I went ahead signed the divorce petition.

I was no longer able to work in the same company……People started treating me differently. I quit the job & found a new one. I wish things could have worked for me…..but I feel I escaped from a lifetime of unhappiness. Probably things would have worked out if Vineeth’s mom is not there…But why should my happiness depend on other person and on her non-existence.

My phone gave me a beep. It was Ravi, the interviewer. He wanted me to meet him immediately.

“It’s good you are going onsite. It would be a nice change” told Ragavi over phone. She is busy with her kid ,but we catch up frequently

“Yes. A change would be good for me.”

“Concentrate on your career now. That’s very critical now.”

“You too ,Ragavi!.I have always concentrated on career. Why is everyone saying that to me when all I want is a normal life…. A life with husband, kids you know….”

“Why are you shouting now? You want me to say , Go marry the first guy you meet immediately. Is that what you want?”

“I’m sorry Ragavi. I’m very upset these days. Probably this is why women prefer to stay in unhappy marriage…..”

“I know it’s pretty difficult practically. But you are only 27. Forget you were married & start enjoying the new work place. And when should you travel?”

“In Another three months….”

“Hey Tarun is crying. I have to go now. Things will happen when it has to. Will call you in the night. Bye”

Every day was different to me. I was more or less in an emotional roller-coster. Few days I didn’t want to get up from the bed and hide inside home. Some days , I was ready to prove the world divorce is not end of my journey. Memories of Vineeth came hit me many times. He was everywhere. The songs we enjoyed together, places we visited together, good time we spent brought tears to me. Inside I knew what I did was correct. But these emotions…..

It was good to work in the new office .No one knows about my past. I was successfully hiding everything behind a smile. Three months just flew by. My parents didn’t want me to travel to a country like Vietnam. But still I feel I’m ready to go anywhere in the earth, than to face my relatives, neighbors. I put a brave face & boarded the flight.
