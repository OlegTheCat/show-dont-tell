‘Daddy take me to the carnival please ‘, the first thing I thought about.

The voice of my daughter is the first thing I would always hear in the morning. The life of a coastal guard is not easy. I remember everything that I’ll miss the most, FAMILY.  My 5-year-old brave daughter and of course with the playfulness is always a joy to watch. My 10-year-old son is who I’m very proud of his growth each day.  They wouldn’t know that I’ve noticed them so much, but the way he takes care of his sister reminds me of my siblings and my parents.

It was the other way around here, I’m the youngest among the 5 of us, getting pampered by all 6 of them shouldn’t be surprising, oh the 6 of them includes my parents in it. I love them so much and speaking of love,  my wife appears.

I am happy, I always wanted this. She should be the last thing I should think about. I always admired her. The way she balanced work and home which I’ve never done and the love from her towards me haven’t reduced a bit since the beginning and what else do I need in life ?. She was the best thing that has ever happened in my life.

I have never thought about them, with this love, with this heart. I wish I could tell them, how much I love them. It’s never too late is what everyone says but with the bullet doing its job in my body the time has come. I said it before, the life of a coastal guard is never an easy task, as I stare at the sky with the final smile and the final thought of thanking God for ‘THE BEST 30 SECONDS OF MY LIFE ‘.
