I stand amazed, gazing up at them. They’re beautiful, sensational, lovely, all of it. All three of my ‘true love’s, the most beautiful creatures of the planet, standing in front of me. Happiness and love washes me over, and I smile, the happiest man in the world. I am speechless, and then I remember the camera in my hands.

Standing in front of me, all three of them, my lovelies, smile, and I press the button. A momentary flash of light and the moment full of love is captured in the camera, for me to see and cherish forever.

I look at them again. All of them, so different, so unique. One of them is wearing a sari along with her jewelry, the other in a simple suit, a pink-ish coloured one, with matching accessories. And the third one is wearing jeans and a top with a large butterfly on the front. They are so different, but there’s something common. They all love me, unconditionally and irrevocably. And so do I.

I thank Him everyday to bless me with three boons, three ‘True Love’s. My life starts from them, revolve around them and ends upto them. I walk up to her and touch her feet. She kisses my forehead.

“Ma.” I whisper, and she smiles, a smile heavy from infinite affection.

I move along to the next and hug her, placing a swift kiss on her cheek. She smiles, blushing, and I feel her arm across my back.

“Wifey!” I tease her and she makes the cutest whiny face.

My third love hugs me tightly and pecks on my cheek.

“Bhaiya (brother)” she says. Before I could reply, –

“Happy Birthday!!” they all announce loudly, leaving me speechless.

“Thank you.” I whisper, tears pooling in my eyes. This is the best birthday present ever…
