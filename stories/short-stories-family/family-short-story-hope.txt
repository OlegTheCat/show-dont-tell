 from 

The time is 5 AM. Sumitra wokeup and started doing her routine works at home. She is a good house wife. She always maintains her lower middle class family with the decent amount given by her husband Raghuram. He is 58 years old and want to take rest in life as he is tired of working enough. He wants to give rest to his old and tired body and mind. He wants to live a peaceful life in his village. They have a son and a daughter who completed their basic degrees and the son Shashank is in search of a job. Daughter Priyanka is a good child. She is at home, helping her mother. The family is looking for a good son-in-law to get their daughter married.

Shashank has attended many interviews, but due to recommendations / high qualifications of other candidates, he never got a chance to win a job. Everyday Raghuram wakes up in the morning thinking that once his son gets the job, he can take retirement and settle in his village.

One day, Shashank told his dad that he is going to attend an interview final round. He was actually expecting that job and hence was very confident.

Raghuram felt very happy and he started to his office thinking that is going to be the last working day for him. He spent his full day planning how to spend his retirement. With a joyful mood, he came back home. His son did not return yet. He was eagerly waiting for the good news.

Shashank attended the interview and was told that the result will be informed in the form of courier in a week. Shashank was tired of the job searches. While in a deep thought, he was crossing the road, a lorry has hit him. He was died on the spot.

The eagerly waiting father did not see him coming home, for his entire life. Few days later, as usual Raghuram started to his office taking his lunch box and umbrella. A Postman handed over a cover to him which contains his son’s appointment letter.
