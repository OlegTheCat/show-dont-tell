All my life I had been very passionate about my choices , my dreams .  I never thought this would happen out of nowhere . After giving  one of entrance test for mbbs , I lost hope that this year I have to sit home but then the result came and I did saw my name in the list . I was literally on cloud 9  . I still can remember how happy my parents were , they received many congrats .  The feeling stayed for some days and then ..

The admission time , my rank was fifteen so I was not sure if I could get the college which I wanted or my father wanted . But that was just the jerry on cake , the icing was about money . I came to know and see the devil side of this education system and how they are super keen to get those coloured paper . When I got this news , I put my self up and asked my father not to pay any money cause for me one year more struggle is better than seeing them struggle for next five years . We argued and I won . For now I was feeling undescribable ,  as at one point I was happy that at least I was in list and at other that I was going to miss the chance to get in a college this year . 

Who knew life would be playing hide and seek with me . Few days back I was carefree and happy and now just so much burden I feel on my self . I keep asking myself how is life and I reply to its hard . Why? Because it is . You want something you see it there but before you can take it the shop of life closes or someone else gets it before you want it . Life’s hard my friend.  

I still remember the face of my father and tears by my mother’s face and it still kills me . 

When life gives you lemon , make lemonade.

This quote I had heard before but never knew how to do so . Now I was in a situation where I wanted to practise this but again how ?  

But then something happened and the whole table flipped …..
