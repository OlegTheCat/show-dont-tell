Family Story – Night Train

Photo credit: 

 from 

Night 9.30 train. Hus and wife  all tired boards the train. One big family in the next cubicles. Full of noise, laughing happy big family in neighborhood. Hus as usual busy , reading messages in smart phone. Smiling at whatsapp videos and comments.Connecting with friends ,very happy in his world. Wife, thinking about next day and coming days in her life. Making to-do list, planning things all tensed and worried wondering how she is going to handle her family, office, kid all alone.

3 different worlds in one bogie of train.

Now starts the journey,kids goes into sleep and family settling down. Husband still in his world not bothered about other worlds .Wife continuous with her master planning and falling asleep in between.

Lights off and only voice of snoring . Suddenly Hus is thrown out of his world , network disconnected. He is now back in the world with remaining people. Looks at his wife all irritated, how can she be so happy and sleeping , snoring of big family all around . He tries to join the others,too late,he can’t sleep. Why can’t  wife  wait and do all planning when he is back? why can’t she wake up now and give him company?.

Who is wrong and right here.

Hus – who was never with his wife and always joins late,who is always busy building network for future career and good life.

Wife-who always takes all planning and responsibilities on her head and can’t wait till he is back,doing planning even while sleeping.

Or the world around, whom they think  is not fit for them , always laughing and disturbing them when they need peace!!

Can’t these 3 worlds be in SYNC. Imagine the train of happiness when all the 3 worlds meet, will it ever happen  or everyone will do their part and get down when time is up.
