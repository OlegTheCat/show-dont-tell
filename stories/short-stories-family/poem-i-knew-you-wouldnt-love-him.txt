I knew you wouldn’t love him for all the scars he left on you when you were young.

I knew you wouldn’t love him for all my crying nights in front of you.

I knew you wouldn’t love him for he left an ‘infant’ in the cradle never looking back.

I knew you wouldn’t love him for he made you a ‘Fatherless child’ for another woman.

I knew you wouldn’t love him for all the time you needed him the most and never he was there.

I knew you wouldn’t love him for all the ordeals the society gave you.

I knew you wouldn’t love him for the tears that rolled up on your cheeks when they castigated me for rising you on my own.

I knew you wouldn’t love him for he did not set a perfect example for a “perfect family” so that you wish to have one.

I knew you wouldn’t love him for he would make you guilty for telling people that you are his son.

I knew you would not love him. I knew you would hate him.

I knew you would hate him someday yearning with the pain of having a ‘heartless father’.

I knew you would hate him for all the pain he gave you that haunted you every time .I knew you would hate me.

But I loved you. For you had given me the reason and breath to live. You might be just his living son but you are everything to me.

I still remember the night you were whispering “Father!Where are you?”.

I was scared. I was scared of the fact that dearth of his love might make you believe less in yourself someday.

I was afraid that you would fall in the pit like me someday.

You might be just his son but you are everything to me.

So I lied. I lied he was dead.
