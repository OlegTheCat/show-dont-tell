This is the story of a girl who was appearing a mentally challenge person and the story revolves around her past and present life. Sometimes people see and accept the truth which is not the reality. At the end of my story, people can understand the difference between the truth and reality.

Shweta was a girl who always considered as a burden in the family and considered as abandoned and unwanted family member in her house. She was not allowed to come and take lunch or dinner with her family members and nobody talks to her.But what was the reason behind this?

The beginning of this story starts from the flashback when one day, she saw that her brother was entering inside the closed door and when she opened the door, she found that her brother was inside the closed door. She begun to shoot “Ghost, Ghost, Ghost. You are a ghost”. But her brother replied “I am a living human being, not the ghost”. This incident took place before the family members when she cried and they came to see her.

After sometime, family members saw that Shweta was taking the drugs injection back from her hand. Shweta tried to make them understand that when the power was not there, somebody has caught her and gave the dose of drug injection.But nobody agreed with her. After one week, she listened that she will be killed one day by an unknown voice but she decided that she should not be scared because with the passage of time Shweta realized that somebody is trying to make her mad by creating some scenes and if she will react then she may send to mental asylum by the family members.

So she decided to caught that person red-handed but who was behind this incident? everybody likes her in the family but the incidents happens in the dark.

Did Shweta succeeded or got in the trap of the criminal? Who was the culprit and what was the motive behind it?
