Remorse Short Story – The Last Letter

I didn’t get the chance to ask her why or where. I heard the door knob click and the silence that followed. By the time I reached the door, she was out and nowhere to be seen. It was a little past two in the night.

“Ahhh! Must be that crave for midnight ice-cream” – I thought or maybe she felt lonely and needed a stroll. I never figured out why she doesn’t talk to me. Despite of my innumerable attempts to strike a conversation with her, there isn’t a single time that I received a reply. Her silence sometimes makes me think that she doesn’t even acknowledge my presence. But still I couldn’t leave her. I just couldn’t let her go. I needed her, at least for few moments more. But where was I going to find her?

I decided to wait for her as I knew there wasn’t a way to track her down. I was immersed in her thoughts when my eyes fell on the calendar.
