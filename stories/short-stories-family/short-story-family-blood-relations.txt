“I am coming to you and very excited. After a long time am visiting you. This will be the most happiest day of my life as I was expecting. But a short distress, discomfort and eager,”What’s happening?”.

I completed my graduation, in search of job and helping my father. Actually he was the only one left for me. He’s my best-friend, advisor, well wisher…. We both are happy with each of us. We never fought for anything, just close friends living happily.

But a day has come which ha changed everything in my life. I fell in love with my friend when I was studying. My father came to know of it unknowingly, but never uttered a word at me nor orderd me. One fine day he came with his parents to my father about marriage proposal. Dad didn’t agree. He never opposes me in anything but said no. I too agreed with my fathers decision. Days passed. Nothing changed. My friend urged me for the marriage and asked me to come. Firstly I regretted but unknowingly started from home.

Now I am on the way and reached him. Celebrations started, all are happy. But I am thinking of my dad. Finally time has come for marriage. I know I was on the last brick. Tears filled my eyes. Nothing stopped me. I thought as if I was dead.

“My dad who brought me up and gave me everything,left him alone and did a blunder. I betrayed him.What kind of a foolish thing i had done. No this should not happen,whatever may be I will go. I want my father”.

People were astonished as all of a sudden rituals were stopped. They tried to convince me but I was about to leave the place. Suddenly I heard a voice calling me. It was my dad. I hug him and crying terribly. My father consoled me and started the celebrations. Finally all are happy.

“Relations are not easy to break.It takes a life to build relations but to break is easy.”
