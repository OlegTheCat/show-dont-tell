Thriller Short Story – The Contract

Dear Readers,

The excerpt you are about to read was found in an abandoned car.  The tow truck driver was a friend of mine and had found loose papers thrown about in the back seat of the car, and thought I would be interested in reading them. The writing was that of an elderly man. Upon reading, I feel eerily connected, as if I need to share this story with the world.  I have made no changes or revisions of any kind.  Read at your own risk.
