Suspense Short Story – Whose There

The mighty wind blew. It was dark and cold. Everything was still as I gasped for breath. I walked as fast as I could. Afraid to turn to left or right. It was miles till I reach home. My mind racing against time. Fear gripped me as in the silence of the night I could hear whispers that came alive in my mind.

What were these whispers”? I wondered. It went like Hey. your not alone walk with me and touch my hand. I pulled my warm scarf over my ears and started to run. My heart beating against my chest. Tiredness mixed with fear crippled my thoughts. I was still far from home and pinched myself hard to think of the comfort they enjoyed.

Just as I was beginning to settle down with my thoughts. The sky opened up her taps and rain showered down without mercy. Thunder and lightning added to the fear and I stopped to shelter under an old oak tree. Hunger engulfed me and I searched my wet handbag for something to eat, any thing would do now.

Whispers filled the air, this time louder. Your not alone walk with me and touch my hand. I crouched under the tree and hid my face in my lap. Pulled the cap closer to my ears to shut out the madness. Whispers came closer, whose there I shouted, pretending to be bold as my fear took hold of me. Soooooh! touch my hand, open your eyes.

“I will not harm you”, said the voice. Slowly I lifted my head an old man with a silver, iron hand stood before me. He had only one arm. His blue eyes were filled with pain. His hair was long and gray. Touch my hand he whispered, I long for a human touch. I reached out my hand to touch him and in a moment of astonishment his hand transformed into wings.

Who are you?” I begged him to say. I.m Neolez the guardian of the lost. Now sit on my wings and shut your eyes. We flew through the dark clouds in great speed and I could hear whispers again. Your not alone, touch my hand.
