Bang… went the fire works at 3:00 in the morning I don’t know why. Arrrrr a ear piercing noses come from a girl outside. I quickly ran to my window and looked outside. There was a girl standing there with blood trickling down her face. I ran down stairs as fast as I can when I got down stairs I couldn’t see her, I was worried. Throw my head I was thinking where was this girl going, what happened to her.

I got in my girl and looked everywhere in LA for her I couldn’t find her. Bang!! a Van had ran into the front of my car I was hurt with a little gash across my head people got out of the Van and were putting guns at me I did not know what to do so I got out of my car and ran for it.

It felt light I got got electrocuted in my leg the pain was unbearable some big guys Tarazed me. The men who attack me put a potato sack over my head and chuck me into the sorter of vehicle. It felt like ages in this car but I knew it wasen’t that long since Ive been in here.

We finally stopped the men throw me out of the car I hit my head really hard they took the sack off my head then I reached into my pocket and found some sorter of gun I grabbed it out but there was no bullets in it they Tarazed me again and I had passed out.

I woke up in my bed I was thinking Ummm What The Hell just happened, was it a dream of some sort. I don’t know so I started to look for this girl again.
