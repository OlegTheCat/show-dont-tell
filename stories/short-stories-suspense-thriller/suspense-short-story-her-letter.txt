After a hard day at my work, I decided to walk home. I usually preferred to catch a bus, but that night I was exhausted and couldn’t cook for myself. So, I bought myself my favorite Chinese noodles from a Chinese stall near my office. My office wasn’t too far from my house. I had already covered half the distance to my home, when, I noticed a girl walking ahead of me. She was tall, pretty, with long blonde hair which she had let free. She had dressed herself with cosy clothes.

Though it wasn’t too late but the street was quite and dark. I could hear something in that dark silence, I could hear someone sob. Suddenly the girl’s feet stopped to walk. I wondered what might have happened, so, I walked to her, “Is everything fine?” I asked.

The girl turned towards me and broke down. I tried to soothe her; I offered my hand kerchief to her. She wiped her tears. “Ma’am, Is everything fine?” I repeated curiously. “No!” she yelled at me and returned my hanky in anger. The hanky slipped, I bent down to pick it up. As soon as I stood straight I had found that she had already left. I wondered, “What had happened to her?”; “why could I not help her?”; “was she into any problem?” many such questions arouse in my mind.

While placing my hanky back into my pocket, I could feel a piece of sheet with it. I thought it was my to-do list. Just to verify I had unfold the sheet and I realized I had never seen that sheet before. It wasn’t my list, it was a letter and maybe it belonged to that pretty lady. Maybe she had mistakenly handed it to me while returning my hanky. I started to read it,

 I acknowledged that the pretty lady was named Jiya. I continued,

Then I realised the reason for her tears. I hoped her to be fine and continued to walk.

Thereafter I walked through the same way for a couple of days to return her letter back, but could never see her again.
