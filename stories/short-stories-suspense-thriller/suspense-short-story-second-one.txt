Bum,bum,bum.The jingle made for olx ad is playing somewhere. A cleanly polished shoe moving according to music. Of course the shoe wore by a man called Prathiroop.

‘get off,move aside’ a glass shop owner shouted at him.

Prathiroop has been leaning on his furniture on the footpath of a road. The owner still saying something but Prathiroop didn’t care to listen cos he’s staring at a person who stands on the other side of road with awe and suprisie . As we all assume He’s not seeing a beauty nor a movie star nor his worst enemy,he’s seeing him. Yes, he’s glancing at the man who looks like just him. He’s in complete surprise. The second one’s completely look like Prathiroop. Each of them standing on each side of road, Prathiroop’s on left the second one’s on right.

Prathiroop starts walking and slips off and set back. To increase his surprise or for what reason the second one’s also slips off and set back. It’s more like imitation. This unexpected move raises prathiroop’s awe. He pretend to be fall once again to see what happens. For god-only-knows-reason the second one just imitated prathiroop. The second one taking this as a joke n enjoying it. But prathiroop feeling so strange thought this whole thing ‘s a dream.but it’s not.

An idea come to Prathiroop and he take wallet out of his trousers. The second one’s did exactly the same. Prathiroop’s pull a ₹ 1000 note drop it on the ground hoping the second one wouldn’t repeat it. But the second one did just the same by let go of a thousand note. It’s still unbelievable,incredible to prathiroop. He’s very annoying. He runs on footpath with irritation…… .

 Prathiroop getting mad but felt fear after seeing a car speeding towards the second one from his backside. He warned him signalling him to stop with a mute shout……

 Unfortunately,the second did exactly the same. Prathiroop feeling sad about the second one. They both reaching the end of the road. The second one disappear like a ghost and strangely the car too gone. But a car hit prathiroop coming from his back. His body flying into sky like athlete in poll jumping. At the peak of his ascending, he realised that the other one not imitating, the second one signalled to warn him.

* * *

prathiroop body touched down the ground pretty hard like a two deep lovers hugging after centuries being apart. The music is still playing. His heart still beating like clock tickling which is supernatural,he’s alive but after seeing the glass shop owner ordering his workers who are lifting a big MIRROR on the right side of the road,he’s dead like a 90 year old surviving hard with his wife throughout his life dying after knowing she’s his mother, the music stops now.
