Gulliver was a brave guy, he got angry and said:“Who are you? Why do you  want to kill me?”

the creature said:“My name is Kelly, I want to kill you because your father killed me and I want to take revenge!”

Gulliver said:“Why did he kill you?”

Kelly said:“I was news reporter, one day a man told me that your father was doing some illegal things, so I called him up and told about this, so he told me to meet him at his house, when I reached there, he welcomed me in and gave a glass of juice which was poisoned, I drank it and died! That time I promised myself that I will leave Earth only after I take revenge!”

Gulliver pleaded:“Please forgive my dad and let us go!”

She said:“OK, I will forgive you but you should do something to complete my promise”

Gulliver asked:“What is it?”

She said:“Kill your family!”

Gulliver’s temper was raising as he heard Kelly laugh loudly, and suddenly said:“NO WAY! Are you kidding me! I can’t kill my family! I can help you in some other way.”

“It’s too late! Go back to the place where you left your family!” said Kelly frowning.

Gulliver rushed back to the place where he had left his family. When he reached there, he found all of them hanging their necks by ropes. Gulliver didn’t believe his eyes, he burst out screaming:“NO!” he turned back to escape and save his life when that scary creature was waiting for him to kill HIM. Kelly caught Gulliver’s neck and pushed him to the wall and pressed his neck until He died!

Then Gulliver got up from his sleep at morning 6:30 scared and murmured:“What a nightmare!”

Saying so he checked for Sonora, who was sleeping peacefully beside him. He then went and check the children’s bed room, and for his relief, they were also sleeping peacefully. He went back to his room and was about to lie down when his phone ranged, it was his boss’s call, he answered it and said:“Good morning sir!” and the voice from the other side said:“Good morning, you’ve got promotion to SAN-FRANCISCO.”
