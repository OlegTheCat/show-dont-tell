She turned the key over in her hands several times before getting out of her car. She knew it was wrong to go into his house when he was just twenty minutes away, but she needed to smell the sweet scent of his cologne again; and she wasn’t about to go up to him, she wanted to feel the rush.

As she walked into his room, she knew something was wrong.

 She thought.

She could hear the footsteps coming up the stairs. She quickly looked around the room for a place to hide. 

she thought. And of course, she picks the closet.

Once inside the closet, she looked around, waiting for the bedroom door to open, there was a huge box sitting on the floor. Surprisingly, big enough for her to fit in! She tip-toed over to the box and opened it. She gasped as she starred in horror at the surprise she got. Inside of the box, there were pictures of her, hairbrushes that had blonde hair in them, toothbrushes that looked just like the ones she had once lost, and more pictures of her. Her heart was pounding in her chest.

With all of the attention that she took off of the person in the other room, she didn’t notice that the door was open and 

 was in the doorway. He was looking down at her, mouth twisting into a grin, eyes filled with excitement  She looked straight at his eyes and blinked. His expression changed from a little bit creepy, to angry.

He knew what he had to do.

 He thought.

But of course, he could not. 

As he looked down at her, he knew that he could very easily kill her. One snap and she would be gone.

 he argued with himself.

He told her, calmly, to put everything down and, slowly, walk to the bed, nothing was going to happen to her if she does as he said.
