The road was rough, the cloud darkened and his palms sweating; even though it was cold all around. There seems to be no life but that of trees around. “You don’t belong here,” he felt one of the trees say to him. Houses very old-looking and gray. Looks like a bewitched city. 

e wondered tirelessly as he wandered.

Greg had been with his friends at the beach by 5:00 pm before something that seemed like an earthquake had separated him from them some twenty-five minutes after Cloe had said, “Nothing can take you away from me”. The last he remembered was the ground shaking and him sinking in; but he had not sank, he was sure. He was still all clean in his jean and blue top that now looked even newer than the surrounding. Also, this didn’t look like under earth, but rather it looked more like a place in England back in the 17th century. A deadly dreaded thought then came; 

He forced the thought out of his mind immediately. But it wouldn’t go. He felt a mix of fear, excitement and hope whirl up within him, just like a whirlpool and he wondered why. Fear of the unknown; excitement of the possibility of a new adventure and above all a hope of correcting something in the past. But what would he want to correct? What if he didn’t make it back, to Sly, Cloe, Clara and his dearly beloved mum Patricia.

The thoughts kept rushing in, he wondered long, then he suddenly discovered that there was a sound from afar, it kept on rising louder and louder and then at the halt, he heard his mum’s sweet voice; “Greg dear, how was your night,” that was what she woke him up with every morning… What sort of dream that was, today was going to be his first day at college. It doesn’t seem like it’s going to look good over there. Thoughts…

“Mum, I’m coming,” he said as he jumped out of bed. “Alright dear, breakfast’s ready,” she shouted back as though he didn’t know.
