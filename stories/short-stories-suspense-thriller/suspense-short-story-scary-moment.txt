Once upon a time, In a small village in Maharashtra… Dhira, just 16 year old guy, was walking on the lonely road. It was about 11.30 PM. He was returning from his friends house to his home. It was very dark and raining too. He was walking along the passway. There was quiet. Only the “sleek, sleek” sound was coming out of his footwares. There was a lane of farms besides the passerway.

Suddenly he saw a woman wearing white saree near the well which was located just in the middle of the farm. She was not wet though there was heavy rain. She was holding a lamp in her hand and trying to come out of the farm. Dhir saw this and was thinking should he help her or not.

“Who is she?” he exclaimed. He was frightened a little but then he decided to talk with her. He was unable to see her face but still he asked, “who are you?? Are you trying to get out of this farm?”.

“I am Savitri, I have to go inside this well” She continued,”But, I am not finding the way to go”.

Dhira get shocked. “Are you mad? What is in that well? Why the hell are you going there?” Dhira continued,”Where do you live? Let’s go….I will drop you till your home.”

She didn’t listen and jumped directly into the well. Dhira got scared and he began to run on the way to his home. When he reached, he start sweating and scared. He told the whole incident to his granny. His granny was also shocked but later she handled the situation and she made Dhira to sleep.

Next day, they heard the news that someone got sink in the well and died. And she was her neighbour. ‘That’ woman was having the habit to walk while sleeping. When Dhira came to know this, he was very sad and he was feeling guilt that he could not saved her only because of his fear.
