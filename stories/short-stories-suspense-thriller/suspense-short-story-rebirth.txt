After having his supper he went to his room and stretched himself on the bed with a blanket over his body. The window on his right was open and he was starring at the crescent moon. Now and then the moon would hide herself behind the clouds as if shy to float alone. But the blanket of the clouds would fly away and the moon would be alone again.

Khurram closed his eyes trying to sleep but something fell on the floor disturbing him. He got up and switched on the light. He rubbed his eyes and searched the floor. There in a corner was a stone to which an envelope was tied. Khurram was surprised to find that stone with an envelope attached to it. He went to the window and looked out. There was no one to be seen, not a soul save a cat who also disappeared into the trees. He went to that envelope and opened it. There was a letter inside it. Khurram unfolded it and started to read it. It went as:

 

Khurram knew that very well that he was afraid of the dark. Although he was ten years old but you wouldn’t have believed that for he was just a mere skeleton. His heart was beating faster. He was angry after reading that letter. He thought it was a shame to stay behind.

Eventually he decided that he would go and prove that person wrong. The time was 11:50pm. He switched off the light and started for the Ganpat Park bravely. Now and again he would be scared by some noise in the bushes. When he had covered half the distance rain started to shower. By the time he reached Ganpat Park he was completely wet. He went inside the park and there he found someone sitting on a bench facing away from him.

“I am here” said Khurram moving towards him a little afraid.

“I thought you will not come” said the person hoarsely.

He got up and turned towards Khurram saying “By the way happy birthday son!”
