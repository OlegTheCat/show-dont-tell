There’s a haunted palace in Jaipur in which the queen of that palace after her death became a ghost and stayed there forever till now those people who have broken the rules has never come back.

A crew from America had come there to research on this ghost, they were excited to see this ghost but in that crew two were students and was very excited about seeing this ghost so they rushed to see what’s there,at the time they reached the palace it was 4 PM and they had only one hour time to stay in the palace but they broke the rules and stayed there after 5. The time was 5:30 and not even an ant stay there after 5 but they stayed there and they got readied all their paranormal activity instruments by the time they got it ready it was 6:30 and there was just 12 minutes for sunset.

They take rounds go inside the palace it was 11 and they found nothing so they planned to go back but suddenly some disturbance came in their instruments but their other devices was showing negative so they were returning back and suddenly while walking one of the boy got a feeling that someone is following them and he told that to the other, so they stopped walking and turned back and saw but there was no one as they turned front there was that ghost of that palace standing in front of them they both ran from there they were so scared that while they were running they got separated and one guy ran somewhere deep and the other escapes the palace and call his crew and wait there.

The crew reached the palace and the time was 8 AM by they reached the palace. The escaped guy was in such a shock that he even couldn’t talk properly and he was just telling there’s a something horror in the palace. So they gave him a injection and made him sleep in their bus and they went in search of the other guy, they searched for him everywhere without leaving a corner but they got him nowhere and they were still in search of him it was already 4:30 and the watchman gave an alarm to go out of the palace. They asked watchman whether has he seen a guy he was here whole night but the watchman answer was “you will never get him back, people who have gone in at night time has not yet come back and will never come back” and he runs away.

So the crew stays that night they’ll have paranormal experts, Fathers and the devices they need and go back at night everyone got ready with their things and one of them gives walky-talky to every one, they all got ready to go and they make 6 groups of 3 people and they move on, they name the groups in numbers as group 1-6.

They go on in and a paranormal expert asks to come in some kind of cave but they ignore and tell not to go but still he’ll go in and the rest of the two in the group wait there but it was already one hour he went in but he didn’t come back so they decided to go in while going in there was a dead end nowhere else to go there was no one and they inform other team members about it but while coming out of that cave only one guy comes out and the other is missing he informs even that to others and a screaming voice come from the cave the single guy from that group runs away from there meet up some other group and tells them to get out of the palace he was so scared he was begging to go out of the palace and after that they take him with them, and in 18 they lost 2 and there were more 16.

Now that group goes in the queen’s room unknowingly in which no one even dares to go and there was a box they opened it there were some jewelries and clothes of the queen they take it out and suddenly some disturbance comes to their device so they take out the spirit tracker and it was showing that it was back of them but nothing was there suddenly a device started to make horrible sounds and it was so loud that they switched it off thinking its broken and they didn’t take anything from there they just kept all the things where it was and turned back and suddenly the ghost was there just back of them it took off their heads and burnt them all.

Now they lost 4 people and 12 were alive and 2 groups meet up in some place and decided to be together they move on after a while the meter show its near them, the fathers sprinkle the water around them so that the ghost doesn’t do anything to them if its near them,they think of returning back to bus and they call all their other members back to bus, while coming back a group get a bad smell of a dead body they go near and fell somewhere in, some sort of horrible screaming and crying sounds started coming and blood starts coming from their ears and they start shouting for help one of a guy heard the screaming of them and go for help with others after they go for help there suddenly screaming voices for help stop before they reach there they had become ashes and they didn’t get to know this.

Now they lost 3 more people from their crew now in 18 they had only 9 people they rush out of the palace to the bus and the boy in the bus was missing they search him out of the palace but they don’t get him anywhere so the left out 9 just leave the palace leaving him, while on the way suddenly that boy who was missing came andfell in the middle of the road from top, they all got out of the bus and went to see but 1 of them tell not to go near him but they don’t listen to him as they went near him and suddenly he started flying and his whole body catches fire and became ashes, they all went off from there.

All were scared and they knew this might be the end of their life but they still went back to the palace, this time they planned to stay together. They all went deep in the palace, they keep on walking but then suddenly some horrible sound came so they ran more deep in the palace, suddenly they found that one of the guy was missing they slowly went back suddenly a body fell, they slowly went and saw who was it shockingly it was him then suddenly they started running back they saw the ghost was there, they got scared and they ran from there but they go somewhere more inside and there suddenly they found that they had got separated from 3 guys, now here these 3 guys are still running and there came a dead end they saw back and there was no one so now they thought of going out of the palace they started going from where they came in but they came back where they were and now they got to know that they have got stuck in that place and it’s the trick played by that ghost now they thought they have to wait till morning so they just sat and started praying, here the other side these 6 people were searching for them but they got no one and even they were lost, one of them thought of getting separated and search for a way out and they did the same thing.

Now here the 3 guys who had got separated heard some screaming voices from their team members but one of them told them not to go anywhere just keep on praying till morning but they both didn’t listen to him as they went out from where they were the ghost came in front of them and turned them also into ashes now only 7 were left.

Another 3 guys who were going in search for way out found something is shining in some kind of room one of the them went in and saw there was gold and diamonds he called the others and as they also went in and suddenly door got closed two of them got killed very cruelly but it couldn’t even touch that other guy because he had Jesus cross with him, he ran out from there and searched for others but the ghost didn’t leave him to meet others but he got that one guy left out now they both started in search of the others they tried to contact the others by walky-talky and phone but nothing worked so they just went in search of them suddenly they heard screaming of their team members suddenly so the guy with the cross started running and fell and the cross in his hand also fell and the ghost killed both of them.

Here these three guys were trying to contact the others they did not know anything what had happened to others but they almost was out there they had found a way out of the palace while they were going out the palace building they lost everyone and even couldn’t see the ghost and suddenly some sound came so they ran back to see what was that, the sound was coming from some room so they went near that room but suddenly the guy back of them stopped them and told not to go but it was dark and suddenly that ghost pulled one them they both started running out the palace suddenly it appears in front of them but it killed one and other was so scared he was running and he heard the ghost saying “tell the whole world not to come to this palace again and I’ll never go from here and kill whoever comes here again” and he runs out of the palace he was wounded and shocked he fell unconscious.

When the escaped guy got up the people was asking him what happened he was just telling the words what the ghost had told him “the ghost told me tell the whole world not to come this palace again and I’ll never go from here and kill whoever comes here again” so the doctors thought he had become mental so they took him to a hospital.
