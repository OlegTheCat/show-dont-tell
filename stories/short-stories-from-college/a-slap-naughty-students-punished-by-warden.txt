Our residential school was in a small town in a mountain valley. One Saturday Evening few of friends went to watch movie in theater by breaking our hostel rules. In non-multiplex era ticket was checked during the movie, a person with small torch would come to everyone’s seat and verify the movie tickets.

While we were watching the movie quietly and also scared for breaking the hostel rule. Suddenly one of our friend got very excited and shouted “See the ticket checker looks like Dhillon”, nick name for one of our teacher.

Then Ticket checker slowly came near to us keeping his torch light down and gave a tight Slap to my friend. Then we all realized he was not Ticket checker, he was actually our sir who raided the movie theater to catch us red-handed and punish us for breaking the hostel rule.
