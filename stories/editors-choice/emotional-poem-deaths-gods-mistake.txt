Poem – Some Deaths are God’s Mistake

Dear death,

 How can you knock her door without even a trivial sympathy ?

 How can you forget the little baby in her arms ?

 How cruel you are to remove her smile forever!

 How brutal you are as you decided to live us in darkness!

 Why can’t you let her live and take

 somebody who really desire you?

 Why do you made her breath her last

 without giving even a slight indication?

Dear death,

 May be you are right

 She strives hard to live

 She suffer a lot of pain

 But she loves to live

 You didn’t allow her.

Dear God

 May be you had created a beautiful heaven for her

 in which she will be treated like a princess

 just to compensate all the worries that

 You had deliberately given to her

 You may think that makes her happy

 but unfortunately you are wrong

 You can’t see her smile there

 because in the midst of all her worries

 she loved everyone

 she wanted to live with some beautiful souls

 whom loved her a lot

 You give her a painful life

 but she didn’t complain

 instead she invoke you with her prayers

 and ask everyone to believe You

 You give her a painless death

 whom everyone wish

 but she never forget the mental strain she go through

 and never forgive you for taking her away

 from what she wanted the most

 She will cry throughout as

 she can’t see her baby anymore

 She shed tears as he can’t see her again

 She curse herself for becoming too good

 She will get angry seeing the helplessness of her family

 she feel shame on herself for making

 them inseparable with her

 She feel guilty for making everyone dependable

 She will feel jealousy for everyone

 who can see, touch and care her son.

Dear God,

 May be you loved her innocence to the core

 and invite her to your world to experience her love

 but remember you will fail in your attempt

 as she can never love somebody

 more than her son

 even if it is the “Creator Himself”

 She doubts you as you crushed her dreams

 she will get frustrated as she trust you

 and pray to you in the earthly life

 She will  hate you for separate her from her son

 She will fall as a victim of depression

 when she saw her son’s grief

Dear God,

 Everything you done were wrong

 give life to such a beautiful soul

 let all who know her to get addicted with her

 give her a fate which possess so much of worries

 and give her a death that leads to the misery of many

 you may do it in the intention of giving her a rest

 but it will only make her restless

 To err is human not divine

 if you can’t foresee the consequences of you deeds

 then, what is the difference between you and us!

 This death is Your mistake!
