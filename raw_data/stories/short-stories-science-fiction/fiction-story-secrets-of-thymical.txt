“This one’s special.” Her Goddess said. One of the elders, the most wisest of them all touched the baby girl’s forehead, which glowed, “Yes. I simply know that, Thyme. She is the Chosen One. We need to put her back into her mother’s tummy.”

Thyme firmly shook her head, “No! No. She’ll stay with us. It seems her loved ones will betray us. We can’t let her endure the pai-”

“NO. YOU MIGHT BE THE GODDESS, BUT FATE DECIDES IT FROM HERE. YOU MAY NOT CHANGE FATE. NEVER. EVER.”

Thyme looked surprised, “W-wow. L-leyla. I n-never knew! You might be an ancient, powerful, wise dragon but it doesn’t mean that…… you’re right.. But I’ll never rest knowing that she’s safe.” Thyme softly snapped her fingers, “I know! I’ll change into a random little girl, and Leyla, you may be the dog. Their house dog.”

“Dog food, for that long? FREAKING CRAZY! No way!” Thyme softly sighed, “Go. To. Their. Door. Step. Now.” Leyla nodded then plunged onto the earth

_

I breathed in the fresh air. The welcoming, sweet smells of home. I turned to my dog, Leyla and exclaimed, “Race you!” I started running, my wavy blondish brown hair flying in the air. As soon as I reached my house, I took a deep breath. I knocked on the door.

“Who is is i- Paradise!” I was crushed into a big hug. “M-mom… can’t…. Breath…”

Mom let go, “Paradise Memphis Kandisky! How dare you greet your mom like that!” She faked glared at me.

I smiled sheepishly, “Sorry mom.”

Mom smiled which technically didn’t reach her eyes, “Where’s Ley- Oh! Hi Leyla!”

I chuckled, “Anyway mom, can I come in?”

She laughed and beckoned me to come in. I walked in to find my friends. Maylene, one my best friends smiled, “So Paradise, didja find the Necklace of Thymical?” I sadly shook my head.

Thymical is the legendary necklace, it’s said that the necklace choses the owner that it you can obtain lots of power by only wearing it. The necklace doesn’t get off the person that it choses. If you’re not the person who’s the ‘Chosen One’ then the necklace might shock you. Lots of people are on the quest to find the necklace, but none had succeeded. I am one of those people.

“Listen Paradise, I think you should quit looking for it. It’d be better if Calem took over.” Iris said. Calem just smirked. I was furious, “So you don’t trust me anymore?!” They looked nervous, “Well, Calem just seems a bit more… trustworthy.”

Then my mom piped up, “Paradise, I agree. Give up on your dream to find the Necklace.”

Calem sneered, “I bet you’re not even the Chosen One! Maybe it’s me.”

I was beyond furious. I broke a vase. Then my ‘mom’ screamed, “Paradise. GO. TO. YOUR. ROOM!”

“OKAY! SO WHEN I GO LOOK FOR THE NECKLACE AND I’M THE CHOSEN ONE, I WILL NOT FORGIVE YOU TRAITORS. LET’S GO MAYLENE.” Maylene nodded.

My ‘friends’ snorted, “You? The chosen one? That’s when pigs will fly.” Iris chuckled, “You know Paradise, you’re such a little kid.”

When we reached upstairs, I started packing, “Maylene. Do you want to go with me in search for the Necklace of Thymical?”

Maylene laughed, “Well, duh! Paradise, listen, I have a feeling that you, are the Chosen One.”

I smiled, “Thank you. Lets hit the road.”

As we went towards the door, Julia, (My mom) screeched, “Where do you think you’re going?”

I replied coldly, “In search of Thymical. Let’s go Leyla and Maylene.”

Leyla barked and ran up to me. I opened the door and called out, “I’ll be back. With Thymical. I will never forgive you.”

As we started walking it turned into night, “C’mon. Let’s camp out here. Maylene, you can cook, I will set up the tents and Leyla will guard.”

Maylene smiled, “I will look for some fish and wood.”

I nodded. I started to set up the tents, and boy, they were hard! A few minutes later Maylene came back, “Hey! I got some fish and firewood. Each of you could cook your own, well except for Leyla. She’ll have dog food.”

I got a bowl and put in some dog food. Leyla barked excitedly, then digged in. “Lets dig in!” I exclaimed as I digged in. Maylene burst out laughing, “I can’t believe my friend is a pig.”

I glared at her playfully, “I am possessive of my food.” After we were done eating, I went to the tent. I beckoned Maylene and Leyla to follow. I smiled, “Let’s sleep.” After we got comfortable I fell asleep.

I was walking through the caves of Voltrage. I heard a hushed whisper, “At last The Chosen One has come, the God has informed me that she will come. It’s my duty to guide her to the necklace.”

I saw a faint light, it was dazzling. I followed it. I walked and walked and then the light faded away, I saw something that no one has ever seen. The Necklace of Thymical.

I jolted up, drenched in sweat. Cave of Voltrage? Thats a few kilometres away! I felt something soft beside me, I turned around and saw Leyla who was snoring loudly. I heard soft breathing and saw Maylene, eyes closed. I slowly stood up and went outside the tent, taking in the fresh air. I heard soft feet, “Paradise? Why are you up so early?”

I smiled and shrugged. I saw Leyla trotting over to us, “Hey buddy, did you sleep well?”

Leyla barked as if to say yes. I smiled, “Okay. Let’s hit the road!”

I started packing, “Guys, let’s go to the cave of Voltrage.”

Maylene smiled, “Sure. You seem so eager!”

I laughed and nodded, “I had a dream about that necklace.”

Maylene squealed, “Tell me about it!” So I did.

“Okay. So the Necklace is at the Cave of Voltrage?” I nodded. Maylene started walking, “What are we waiting for? Let’s go!” I motioned Leyla to follow. After an hour later, we decided to have a little lunch in McDonalds.

“We would like to have two Cheeseburgers, and 2 bottles of water, please.” The counter person smiled, “Okay! The payment is $5.60.” I handed her the money has she gave me the change, “You’ll have to wait for 2 minutes, heres your number, 15.”

After two minutes we heard, “Number 15!” Maylene got up and went to get the food. I smiled as I breathed in the delicious aroma, “Let’s eat!” Leyla barked as if to say, Where’s mine? I slapped myself, “Oh dear. Here you go Leyla, your food!” I started to dig in, minutes later I was done. Maylene chuckled, “You practically breathed in your food!” As we laughed together. Leyla barked. I said, “Let’s get to the road?”

I can feel it. I can feel that we’re near. But how long? No one knows.

I stopped, someone was whispering something, “Chosen one. You’re indeed close. You have to follow my voice.” I was shocked, “Huh? Who is it?” The mysterious voice again piped up, “Follow my Voice.” I boomed, “WHO’S VOICE?!” Maylene looked startled. Leyla jumped. “P-Paradise? I think y-you should follow the voice.” I stared at her blankly, how did she know? Maylene smiled, “I know.”

“Follow my Voice, Follow my Voice. Follow.” I heard it again. So I did one thing that changed my life. I followed it. Maylene and Leyla catched up to me, I smiled at them.

Soon after we were in front of the Cave of Voltrage. I gasped at the sight. It had rocks with moss on it. It was indeed ancient.

“Chosen one. This is the place we depart.” The voice said again. I walked inside. I heard a sweet, angelic voice, “The Chosen One! It has at last come! It will save the world from danger. Her Goddess has told us that. I will quote it, ‘“Thee Shall Bring Peace upon the world.”’ Her Goddess has told us to guide her to the necklace. I see Mariyn has done her job. It is now my turn.”

I saw a bright light. It looked brilliant. I heard the voice again, the one had told me to follow the voice, “Follow the light, Chosen One. Fate will guide you from here.” So I followed it.

I followed it, what seemed like minutes. Then I heard the angelic voice, “After I disappear, you shall see it. People will know you’re the Chosen one by seeing the necklace tightly clasped around your neck. May the aura guide you.” Then the light disappeared. I saw something shimmering, I gasped, “Could it be?” It was indeed. The Necklace of Thymical.

I gently picked it up, it shined when I did. I placed it around my neck. It tightened. I gasped. I was the Chosen One.

I went outside to not find Maylene and Leyla but a woman with a gold circlet around her forehead and a ancient dragon. I was puzzled, “Maylene? Leyla?” The women smiled, “I am Thyme. Also known as Her Goddess and Maylene. This is Leyla, known as the sacred dragon of Thymical. My Chosen One, I am the Goddess, Thyme. Leyla is going to be yours. Show those who deceive you. Leyla can transform into different species.” My mouth was open, Me? The Chosen One? Oh god. MY BEST FRIENDS WERE THE LEGENDS. I spoke softly, “Okay. I will show the who I am, Miss Thyme. Let’s go Leyla.”

“Wait. This is your Chosen One outfit. Now Paradise, may the aura guide you.” She spoke with authority that made me bow. I smiled. I motioned Leyla to follow. I looked down at my clothes, it was gray and purple with gold outlines, saying, PARADISE, CHOSEN ONE. I turned to Leyla, “Do you want to be a dog or stay in your usual form?”

“Usual form.” Leyla said. Wait what? Telepathy. So she’ll stay as a dragon? Oh lord.

I knocked on my old home’s door. It opened revealing my mom, “So Paradise, I see you’ve returned. What’s that? O-Oh d-dear. You’re the Chosen One?” My ‘friends’ came to see what the ruckus was about, “Paradise?” They gasped, “L-leyla? You’re a dragon! So Paradise? You’re the Chosen One?” I simply nodded, “Indeed. I shall not forgive you. I shall show you who I am. Farewell friends.” I spat out friends like it was venom. I got on Leyla and we flew.

“Paradise, Thyme is calling. We shall go to Her Goddess’ place.” I nodded.

I saw the Heavens.

Beautiful.

I saw Thyme.

It happened by a blur.

Thyme talked to me, we laughed.

It was like yesterday I was hurt.

But.

Thee Shall Bring Peace upon the world. Like it says.

I will.

I indeed will.

“Never give up till the end!” I was watching my favorite show, Pokemon XY, Ash is saying that to Serena.

I will tell you what I think.

I think they should bring back Ash-Greninja.

“So why don’t you go threaten Satoshi Tajiri to go and bring back Ash-Greninja?”

HA NO!

I wrote what I did in my diary,

Dear Diary,

I had a time!

It started like this, first, I returned from my journey, then get betrayed, then finding out I am The Chosen One! Wow. I also managed to yank out Thymes coffee handle.

I am laughing like a maniac.

Anyway, till the next time.

I need Ash-Greninja Back!

 Paradise Memphis Kandisky.

I got a new diary with a leather bound cover.

Also I found out there are a TON of members!

There is White, Red, Christina, Lucky, June, Lucy, Simon, Serena and many others.

My best friend is Serena.

A shy girl.

Pretty too.

Oh well.

It sure is hard to take care of a dragon. Leyla’s breath stinks.

I mean real bad.

It reeks.

Like wow.

Her poop is MASSIVE!

HUMONGOUS.

WOW.

I mean, wow!

 

5 years later…

_

Dear Diary,

A lot has happened. There’s an evil force, calls themselves Team Cross are trying to make the world a bad place.

The Guardians are trying to help.

My necklace is powerful.

I am now 16.

Random.

They are sprouting these trees kidnapping people and using their auras to make themselves powerful, and creating something…. I can’t even explain!

Thyme said that this is ridiculous.

This is what had happened in the 5 years.

_

I was walking on the street of Cherry City, I saw black-red trees. They were huge.

One was going straight for a random lady so I used my aura powers, (YES POWERS) to stop it. The lady looked at me in gratitude, “Thank yo- OHMYGOD! YOU’RE THE CHOSEN ONE! THE CHOSEN ONE HAS FINALLY COME! THANK YOU HEAVENS.

THANK YOU!” The lady started hugging me, kind of like choking, “M-miss s-stop.” She laughed, “Okay girl! Good luck.”

A huge crowd surrounded me.

“Chosen one?”

“Mommy? She will save us?”

“Oh thank god!”

“PARADISE! MOVE! SHE’S MY DAUGHTER!”

I heard a particular loud screech.

I growled.

“MOVE MOM. I AM NOT YOUR DAUGHTER. YOU BETRAYED ME.”

She looked shocked.

HA!

I said something to the crowd, “I will save you. We must work together. Do not rely on me. Not always. I will be there.”

I took a piece of their aura so I can know if they’re in danger.

I saw a large tree trunk coming towards them, I used my necklace to cut it, a powerful light shone.

Sorry my hand hurts. Where was I?

Oh yeah.

Sorry.

As the light disappeared the tree trunk was cut.

I mentally congratulated myself.

YAY!

Everyone cheered.

“YAY! GO THE CHOSEN ONE!”

“WHOO!”

I held up my hand to silence them, “It’s not over. Yet, do not party now.” I used my Chosen One Tone, “Thee Shall Bring Peace Upon The World.” I smiled and looked at them.

“May the Aura Guide You.” Was my last word before I disappeared.

That’s my story.

Now in the Real world…

Paradise Memphis Kandisky

I was looking for the base of Team Cross. The world looked destroyed. I knew destruction was near. The Guardians were trying to replace the destroyed buildings.

I was shocked.

The beautiful earth didn’t deserve something this cruel.

I knew it had to be stopped.

But how?

I finished writing my last entry, smoothing out the crumpled pages.

I am flying.

Literally, I am.

It has been 5 years.

5 whole freaking years!

Team Cross started their pursuit 1 month ago.

Its raging.

I see fire.

I see red.

I see destruction.

I looked down at my diary.

It looked old. Ancient.

I had mixed emotions.

We’re the same in the earth.

Alone. Despair.

We have each other.

But the earth doesn’t.

How long can the earth hold on until it collapses?

The time is ticking.

Everyone is counting on the Chosen One and the Heavens.

I can feel everyone’s despair.

I saw a crowd just below me.

So I landed on the ground.

“EVERYONE! THE CHOSEN ONE IS SPEAKING. REMEMBER, Never give up till the end!”

I disappeared like I came.

I heard hushed whispers,

“Who was that?”

“Chosen One?”

“Never give up till the end?”

“She’s right! NEVER GIVE UP TILL THE END!

I smiled.

That’s right.

Never give up till the end.

I summoned Leyla and asked her about the condition, “Bad, Paradise. We need a bit of help.” I said, “Okay. Coming!” I teleported to where Leyla was. One word to describe how the place looked.

Bad.

Real bad.

Red-Black vines everywhere. I heard someone sobbing, I realized it was me.

Me, Paradise Memphis Kandisky, a girl who never cries.

It makes sense.

I looked around for Leyla, “Leyla?” I heard a roar, “Paradise! Here!” I turned around and saw my friend with Thyme and the other guardians. “Paradise. You have a job now, the job is to try to find the base of Team Cross, we will fight the vines so it can’t reach you. Take Leyla.” I simply nodded and then took off with Leyla.

I pondered aloud, “How does a criminal base look like? Hmmm maybe not eye catching! That’s it!” I looked down at the city, one particular building caught my eye, a shed with a red roof. I told Leyla to land. I made myself and Leyla invisible. I slowly crept to the shed and opened the door, I peeked inside. I saw a man with crosses on its black t-shirt talking to an unshaven man.

“Boss, we have the vines reaching the limit. The Chosen One might come.” The unshaven man laughed, “Heh. We’re stronger. A little pesky girl with a necklace can’t beat us! Pfft. Jackel, just relax.” The person, whose name was Jackel didn’t look relaxed, he just simply said an okay. I whispered to Leyla, “Leyla. We should tell the crew we found the shed.” I clambered on top of the dragon and said, “Go!”

“Did you find the shed?” Thyme asked. I did a thumbs up.

Thyme looked satisfied, “They’re stupid. Chosen One, have a suggestion?” I pursued my lips, “Well yes! We could do a surprise attack! Here’s my idea.”

Dear Diary,

I have come up with an idea, here’s the story, I had found Team Cross’ shed. Thyme asked if I did I nodded. She asked for an idea so I simply said, “Well yes! We could do a surprise attack! Here’s my idea, we’ll give them treats, yummy donuts. While they’re eating, we’ll be on the roof, then we’ll break it down! There’s a chance they might choke so we’ll have the upperhand. Then we fight. Sounds good?”

Thyme stared at me, “Girl, that’s brilliant! Let’s write a note with the donuts. I smiled, “I will!”

Here’s the note,

Dear people who live in the shed,

I am from Krispy Kremes! I have heard you needed donuts, so here it is. (The shed does look poor!)

Here’s the Receipt:

10 Original Glazed donuts

25 Spiderweb donuts

10 Mummy donuts

30 Powdered Cinnamon Cake donut

Bon appetit!

Xo,

Krispy Kreme Manager.

Until then Diary!

Paradise Memphis Kandisky.

I sighed. I had come up with a plan.

Thyme said it was brilliant.

I smiled.

I stapled the note on the donut box and climbed onto Leyla. The others are coming too.

“Let’s go, girl!” Leyla roared. I held tightly onto the box.

As we reached our destination I made ourselves invisible. I placed the box at the floor and then knocked.

“Boss? There’s a donut box here.” The boss looked up, “Bring it to me.”

“Dear people who live in the shed,

I am from Krispy Kremes! I have heard you needed donuts, so here it is. (The shed does look poor!)

Here’s the Receipt:

10 Original Glazed donuts

25 Spiderweb donuts

10 Mummy donuts

30 Powdered Cinnamon Cake donut

Bon appetit!

Xo,

Krispy Kreme Manager.”

I heard the manager lick its lips, “Yum. Hey peasants! I have a treat for you!” I heard the gang munching onto the donuts.

“Now!” Whispered Thyme. Everyone nodded.

We smashed down the roof. We heard choking noises. A lot.

“WHO ARE YOU?!” The boss thundered.

I said in my Chosen One Voice, “Thee Shall Bring Peace Upon The World.”

I heard those choking noises again.

Is it choking day or something?

I wasn’t informed.

I used my necklace to stab them.

I felt no remorse.

NONE.

They were bad.

Thyme turned to the leader, “Jester, you’re finished. I feel no remorse to kill you. Goodbye.” Thyme then killed him.

Okay.

WHAT DID I JUST SEE?!

“Guys, we need to make the world how it used to be. We need to get started.”

I turned to face her, “So we go and make the world beautiful when we’re covered with BLOOD?!” I deadpanned.

Thyme started laughing, “No! Oh well. We do need a shower.”

30 minutes later,

“Okay. So I will go to Violet City and rebuild the buildings?” Thyme nodded. Okay.

I started painting the buildings.

One was modern.

One was a house.

One was simple.

I never knew it was fun to paint buildings.

Peach, White, etc.

Cool.

As I was done I looked at my work.

Beautiful.

I continued to do this at Samurott City, Relist City, etc.

5 years later

Dear Diary

This is my last, but longest entry. I am 21.

The pursuit is at last over.

But the worst thing is that…

I AM FREAKING FAMOUS! I WANTED A QUIET LIFE BUT NO! BOO YOU THYME! BOO!

BY THE LORD OF THYMICAL WHY?

The necklace has a voice.

At first I thought it was haunted but no.

It has a voice.

SIMPLE!

I am so dense.

The first incident was like this,

I was busy eating my portion of tortillas, I heard a voice. “Hi! I am Thymical!”

I choked.

I thought it was Thyme with her pranks…

BUT NO!

I found out it was the necklace.

I was like, “Was it haunted?”

“No! I am not haunted!”

It wasn’t.

When I told Thyme the story she was full of mirth. I was kind of embarrassed, “Don’t act like a guttersnipe!”

“The only guttersnipe I met was a boy. He had messy hair. He demanded for some grains of rice. Then he farted, the loudest fart!” She raised her palm as if to swear.

I smiled.

I wanted another adventure.

But I can’t just expect another dude in diapers then demanding to take over the world?

Wow.

That’ll be hilarious.

Be careful for what you wish for.

Because you should.

This morning was the best day.

It’s my birthday!

Everyone celebrated the Chosen One’s birthday.

There was Tortillas, Chips, Balloons, everything that describes a paradise!

I smiled.

Remembering the old times.

I guess this is it.

I am busy munching on the Hot Flaming Cheetos.

You can see the red things.

It’s so good.

Wait, whats this?

Dear Paradise,

Happy birthday! We love you no matter what. I just hope you love your presents.

It has been fun knowing you.

I know! We met when we were on diapers!

Funny, right?

Here’s a note from Serena! (The Gang arranged the Presents.)

Love,

Thyme

Dear Paradise,

Ohmygod! You’re 21!

Freaking 21! It felt like yesterday you found out you were the Chosen One! Your mouth.

I thought a fly was going to go inside your mouth!

The Gang arranged your awesome present.

I am jealous.

Like freakin jealous.

We love you,

Serena.

P.S

Here’s a note from Leyla!

Dear Paradise,

Hello!

I Loved being your dog, but  it was a bit too much.

I love being in my usual form.

You’re the best!

Smell ya Later!

Leyla.

P.S

Mine has dragon slobber.

Thyme literally screamed a high pitched on. God! She was so high!

I wrote back,

Dear Friends,

Thanks so much.

I love you too!

(The flat screen t.v at my room is amazing!)

Paradise.

Paradise Memphis Kandisky

I smoothed out the crumpled pages.

It’s done.

A lot has happened.

I have a T.V

OH MY GOD.

I was happy. Really happy. My friends… my family.

They’re awesome.

The best.

I was thinking of publishing my adventure.

This is my story.

Secrets of Thymical.

May the Aura Guide you.

Everyone.

 

“Hey, Thyme? Do you like babies?” I asked her, Thyme stared at me wide eyed, “Those farting, barfing, demons? Heck, no!” I chuckled, “Wow. It seems like that there’s going to be another child, that we need to put into her destined mother’s tummy.” Right on cue Leyla barged in holding a baby, “Holy twines! This one’s a DEVIL!” I raised an eyebrow, “Literally a devil?” Leyla frantically nodded. I cooed at the baby, “Hello devil baby! Who’s your momma? Huh? Who’s your mom-”

“STOP! Paradise!” Thyme groaned. The baby started giggling, “See?! It’s a DEVIL!” I burst out laughing, “Yeah. I know!”

“Shut up, both of you! Jeez! I know the person who’ll be the perfect mom for her.” Leyla’s hand glowed a faint pink, touched the baby’s forehead, then it disappeared. What the heck was that?

A lot has happened..

–END–
