[MEANING OF “ARTH” – Hilarious Short Story]

MEANING OF ARTH - Hilarious Short Story

Those lecturers are considered good who have a very friendly nature with his/her students, who set easy question papers for exams and of course corrects the paper by neglecting every mistake.

One such lecturer is in our department too. She is favorite of most of the students as she possess almost all the qualities mentioned above. I would like to mention here one thing about her that she is a “south indian” .

Now, it is well known to everyone the relations of hindi(language) and south Indians . it would be no wrong to compare it with indo-pak relations.

so the lecturer I was talking about is blessed with a baby boy six weeks ago. After six weeks, when she came to the class , everyone congratulated her and the chorus began “party….party….party….”

meanwhile a guy stood up and asked her “mam, have you thought of any name ? “. She said “no, you suggest me some good names “.

The guy replied “mam , “arth” (hindi word) is a very good name. short, simple and unique.”

“what’s the meaning of this ?” mam replied.

Everyone laughed (except for those who didn’t understood this) as laughter is the sun that drives winter from human face .
