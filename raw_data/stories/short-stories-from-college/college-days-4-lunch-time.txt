Funny and Hilarious from College Days

The gang was seated in the college canteen for their lunch. Ashwin was the last to collect the food from the counter and join the rest of the gang.

Ashwin had an omlette too besides the other regular items. Swapna said “I thought they do not make non-veg in our canteen on Fridays. How come you are having eggs?”.

Ashwin said “they do not make meat. But they always make eggs”. Swapna said “oh. I did not know that”.

Monica said “let me take a bite from you” and started moving towards Ashwin’s plate. Ashwin lifted his plate and kept out of reach of Monica.

Monica said in a complaining tone “You cannot even share omlette with your friends?”. Ashwin said sincerely, “Monica. I would do anything for you. I will even give my life for you. But just do not ask for omlette alone”.

Monica said “who needs your life anyways? I just need the omlette”.

Swapna and Pradeep burst into laughter with this little fight.

As the gang finished the lunch, they were preparing to leave. Pradeep said “Monica. You two carry on. We will join you soon”.

Monica and Swapna started walking towards the classroom. Once they were seated, Swapna asked “why did the guys stay back?”. Monica said “dont you know? They must be smoking”. Swapna said “but I thought Ashwin had quit smoking”. Monica replied “that you must ask him”.

A short while later Pradeep and Ashwin were back. Swapna asked “Ashwin. Did you smoke?”. Ashwin said “no Swapna. I have quit smoking”. Swapna said suspiciously “but I can smell nicotine here”. Ashwin said “I have quit just 5 minutes back”.

Swapna said angrily “very funny”.

Monica asked “is it such a difficult thing to quit smoking?”.

Ashwin smiled and said “who said so? Quitting smoking is by far the easiest thing to do on this world”. After a dramatic pause, he added “Since it is easy to do, I myself have quit smoking some one thousand two hundred and thirty four times”.
