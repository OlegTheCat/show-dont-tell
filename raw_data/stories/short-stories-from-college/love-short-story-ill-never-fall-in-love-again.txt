Short Story – I’ll never fall in LOVE again

It was very boring. Of course it was Mr. Kumar sir’s class. Physics! I hate it! I was looking at my digital watch and right then the bell rang!

“Hey Aisha!” Somebody called me. I turned back. It was Riya. Who else could it be?

“Hey pumpkin!” I teased her. We call her pumpkin because her crush’s name is Pulkit. And together they are Pumpkin! Crazy right?

“Shut up! And hey I got latest news!”

“What?”

“We have a science assessment next week, we have 3 new comers, Mr. Kumar will be taking our debate class and-”

“Mr. Kumar? Our debate class? What the hell! Okay, continue,”

“And yeah the science assessment we have, is not individual. Its partner- partner this time. And Mr. Ravi is going to choose our partners!”

“What?! This is so irritating. That teacher is going to choose partners for us?!”

“I know right! Let’s move on to the next class.”

“Oh yeah right! Bye”

I left in a jiffy. It was English. Mrs. Gupta’s class. She is one big mumbo jumbo! Come on, She doesn’t know how to pronounce and most of the spellings!

I hurried and then the first seats were caught by Anvi and Avni. The irritating twins! I had to sit at the last.

“Students welcome our newcomers, Annirudh Pal, Sharman Seth and Vanish Sengupta.” Mrs. Gupta said.

Annirudh? Do I know him? Maybe. I think I’ve seen him somewhere. He sat beside my seat. He waved at me. Does he know me? Or maybe he just waved by mistake. I felt I had an old connection with him. But what is it? I felt weird.

I thought about it the whole class. And then finally got the answer! Annirudh Pal and Aisha Singh Topper of the class. How can I forget my worst enemy? Ugh! He used to be my academic competitor. Always he used to win and beat me in everything. Except one. He didn’t know how to socialize or mingle with people. The bell rang. We took our books.

“Hi loser!” Annirudh waved at me.

“Hey idiot Annirudh” I said.

“I didn’t want to hurt you. Take that as a joke.”

“Duh! I’m not a kid like you anymore.”

“Oh really? Remember lizard eggs?”

“Gross! And remember the kick me poster on your back?”

“Whatever. And how are you in this place?”

“Exactly. That’s my question! How are you in this place? And I came here because the previous one was so dumb”

“You don’t deserve to be here! And I came here because the previous one was stupid.”

“You don’t deserve this place too! And please, back off su*ker!”

I left the class. He followed me till the cafeteria. We argued endlessly. And what else people started staring. I left. It was actually fun irritating him. And I could irritate him more. And I had an idea!

“Aisha! Who was that guy? Do you know him?” Riya questioned.

“Yes I do! He’s one of my old enemies.” I said.

“Oh. So I think there is more to you and him.”

“Don’t even think about him and me. Never. Yuck!”

“Why not? Everything is possible.”

“Including you and Pulkit.”

“Shut up! Okay then what next?”

“You know what? I have an exciting plan.” I whispered her the whole plan and we both agreed.

“On it Aisha” Riya said and left.

That idea was tinkering in my mind. It amazed me so much. At the end , while walking home Riya handed me a paper with a number in it. Perfect my plan is going to work. I quickly rushed into my room and reached out for my phone. I dialed the number Riya gave me. I put a thin cloth to make my voice deep

“Hello?” I said.

“Hello. Who is this speaking?” the person asked.

“Hi Ani! How are you my darling?”

“Hi. Who is this?”

“You don’t remember me? I am your secret admirer! I have observed you many times Ani. You are such a smart personality!”

“Well thank you. But I think this is a wrong number.”

“No. This is you Annirudh Pal!”

“How do you know my name? And please stop irritating me!”

“It’s alright my cutie pie! I know you better than you do. Bye!” I hung up!

My plan was working and the prey is slowly getting trapped! I was playing my revenge! Serve’s him right.

It was the next day. I was so excited. I signaled Riya that my plan was working. It was science. And guess what? I am partnered with Annirudh! Ugh!

He kept following me the whole day and asked me about the project. We sat down at the cafeteria.

“Hey Annirudh. Let’s talk about something else other than project.” I begged.

“Not interested!” He replied.

“Oh please! Okay let’s talk about our phones.” I changed the topic. Just in time.

“Okay. And how do we play this?”

“It’s like we tell the people who called us and talked to us yesterday.”

“Okay. First up was my dad. He asked me about the new friends and stuff”

“Mine was mom. She called me to get spinach”

“Then Vanish called me up just to talk”

“Then I dialed a wrong number instead of dads”

“Then an unknown number called. It was a girl. She talked about. Never mind” (I knew he would tell this because he doesn’t hide anything and he is very honest)

“Oh come on tell me. Speak up”

Annirudh blushed and smiled but did not reply.

“Okay fine then. Bye Annirudh.” I said

“Wait wait. I’ll tell you. But don’t spread!”

“Okay fine! Tell me.”

He told me that a girl called him and spoke to him. He loved her voice.

“Go ahead and talk to her.” I suggested.

“I will if I can. But I deleted her entry in my call logs because I got angry at the first.”

“Don’t worry everything will be fine. She’ll call you.”

“Okay then see you later.”

“Bye” I said and left.

Did he really like my voice? Or it is his stupid mind?

I felt a little awkward. I stopped, smiled and wondered. The day went on well. I went back home and called Annirudh.

“Hello Ani!” I said in a sweet voice.

“Hello! -um. What do I call you? And what is your name?”

“You will not know my name. It’s a top secret!”

“Come on. You’re voice is so sweet like honey. But how come I’ve not seen you?”

“You’ve seen me many times. And I have seen you many times as well. We had so many conversations.”

“What name shall I call you?”

“Anything as you wish”

“hmm. I’ll call you Blue moon. As it is mysterious to be seen.”

“Wow nice name.”

“So how was your day?”

“It was nice talking to you.”

“You mean that you talked to me? When?”

“Uh – uh not so fast. I won’t tell you”

“Come on. Where can we meet?”

“Not now. Later. When the time is right”

“Blue Moon, can I ask you a question?”

“Yes of course!”

“Have I really met you?”

“You have.”

“I don’t recognize your voice though.”

“Okay bye! Got to go!” I hung up

I hung up in a jiffy. I was irritating him but I felt bad. Maybe I had feelings for him. May be he was my best friend.

The next day. It was kind of good. But my science partner was Annirudh! I think god is doing all this by purpose.  But he was a smarty- pant. So I guess I should be thankful to god than blaming him. I and Ani were walking to the cafeteria. We ordered coffee and discussed about the dumb project. After that we talked about the rest.

“Hey what about that girl?” I asked him.

“Um. She is fine I guess. Somewhere.”

“Come on. Tell her what you think.”

“No I just can’t do it Aisha.”

“You can.”

“Whatever. Just switch to another topic.”

“No. We are going to talk about her.”

“Ok. I am going to tell you the truth. I think.”

“Yeah. What do you think?”

“I think I like her”

“Whoa! Tell her that!”

“Okay! I am going to face it.” He said.

The bell rang. We were in our Debate class. Ugh so boring. I saw Annirudh dreaming in the class. And then suddenly the teacher called Annirudh to speak. He was blank and got busted. I felt bad. How long should I keep my face hidden from him?

I was home now. I was reading a book. And then my phone vibrated some 10 times.  Messages from Ani! OMG! I saw all the texts.

HI! HOW R U

 CALL ME

 I THINK

 I LIKE YOU

 BLUE MOON, I REALLY WOULD LOVE TO MEET YOU!

 BYE!

 

 

Wow! He really loves me? But wait, He doesn’t know that the actual blue moon is me, Aisha. I’ll tell him a “SORRY” and an “I LOVE YOU” chocolate or card.

I went out to a gift shop, and brought a small I LOVE YOU chocolate box and a SORRY card. I was so excited. And what else? I was in Love!

It was the next day.

I was jumping! I was excited!

“Hi!” I said to Ani.

“Hey Aisha!”

“So how’s it going?”

“Yeah! I am so excited to meet blue moon! She texted me this morning during the first class!” He smiled and said

Wait! Did I text him this morning? No! Is my phone in my bag? I checked my bag. My phone wasn’t there! Who took it?

“Oh good!” I said.

“Yeah. And I’ll introduce you to her as soon as I meet her! Bye!” He said and left.

I was in trouble! I lost my phone. And somebody texted him through my phone! I felt so uncomfortable.

It was break. I was walking to the cafeteria. I saw Annirudh with a girl. Who was she? Maybe a friend.

I walked towards him. The girl dressed in Blue. She had brown curls. I walked towards him with the chocolate box and the card in my hand behind my back.

“Hey! Aisha.” Ani said.

“Hey Ani. I wanted to say.”

“Wait. I want to introduce someone to you, and that is Riya! The blue moon!”

Wait! What!? Blue moon? Riya!? What the HECK!

“Hey Aisha!” She winked at me. An evil wink and in her hand was my phone.

I crushed the card and threw the chocolate box in the cafeteria. People stared at me. I started running to the wash room. I locked myself up and cried on top of my lungs.

From that day on, I didn’t talk to anyone. I was a loner. Aniruddh still doesn’t know why I was angry the other day. I hate seeing Riya and Annirudh together everywhere. But why did she do that to me? She already liked Pulkit.

She returned my phone back a few days after the incident. She told me everything. She used to take my phone from my bag and read all the texts and send him texts too and then delete them. She used to spy on me every time. It seems she was jealous of me and that’s the reason she took Ani from me. I still remember her words.

“He’s mine now Aisha. So you better back off and find a new one yourself.” She had said.

The words kept on repeating in my mind. I hated her. Ani doesn’t even look at me. But it’s a shame that he didn’t come to know that the person he used to talk to, Blue Moon, was me. Maybe Riya is a better companion than me.
