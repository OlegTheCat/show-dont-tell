A content writer from the last 6 months, but writing a personal blog to talk to the world through my words for the first time.

A computer engineer but writer by profession. I think it is a unique combo.

Yeah!

Everything has to be rare in this world. Being common is not a choice now.

I never thought of opting writing as my career but eventually it happened. Now, I am thankful to God for the gift He gave me.

Why I chose to initiate writing a personal blog?

I used to afraid to talk about my life with my friends or relatives in my teenage. I never had ‘good friends.’ But, my college life transformed the way I used to look my life. There were some gems in my classroom who covered all my insecurities and scars with their feeling and true sense of friendship.

Sometimes, words are better written than said. So, I picked crafting my feelings on a laptop than saying it.

My first personal blog is for you my sweetie-

It is 28-Jan-18 and yesterday it was my twin flame’s marriage. I had a flow of mixed feelings. All the scenes of our late night gossips and the canteen chit-chat was running in front of my eyes when I was admiring her in the bridal look. She was looking stunning and the most elegant bridal I have ever seen.

I know nothing remains the same after the marriages’ part happens in our lives. But, the heart is stupid, no! It gets the things later even when the mind already knows it. The see-off time was the most difficult because we both were uncertain about the next meeting. But, I won’t be selfish here. I want her to pay attention to the world in which is entering. May God give her all the happiness and keep the smile on her face which everyone else could see on her special day.

And yes, Jiju you need not worry about anything. She will take care of all the things by herself. All you need to do this is love her endlessly and make her feel special.

May God bless the cutest couple.
