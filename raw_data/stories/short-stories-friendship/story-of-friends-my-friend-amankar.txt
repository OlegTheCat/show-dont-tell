 August 2012, Mumbai.

It was Sunday. I was very much excited. Therefore, I geared up and left the house. I am a columnist in a leading daily newspaper Today’s Voice. Today I was going to meet Dr. Mehta, a renowned person in his field of work. He is an inspiring and imperative person in my life. In fact in many lives.

Dr. Mehta’s office:

P.A. (A woman in the late 20’s): 

Me: 

.

P.A.: 

Me: 

P.A.: 

I read the memo and kept it in my pocket.

P.A.: 

Me:

P.A.: 

So I went there. The room was air conditioned and had comfortable sofas. I sat on one of them. Mrs. Sonakshi, the P.A. sent me a cup of coffee. It was 10.30 am only, so I had to wait more three and half hour. I took out my notebook eased myself on the sofa and had a sip of coffee and this is what followed……

Mr. Ramcharan was very much excited and was at his peak as his wife was going to give birth to her second child after long seven years. Following is the conversation going on at the hospital…………………..

Mr. Ramcharan: 

Nurse: 

Mr. Ramcharan: 

Nurse: 

Ramcharanji waiting anxiously…….

Nurse: 

Mr. Ramcharan (delighted): 

Nurse: 

Mr. Ramcharan gave a fuming look to the nurse and ran toward the door.

Mr. Ramcharan peeped through the door glass. He felt like being in the cloud nine, as he watched his wife and a cute baby lying on her arm. Ramcharanji and his wife’s eyes met each other and they gave a compassionate smile to each other.

Six days have passed and it was the time for the boy to be christened. As of Ramcharanji, he was again at his peak. Ramcharanji become very much animated when some responsibility come over him and cannot calm himself until it is fulfilled. Ramcharanji held a ceremony. Relatives, friends, all were invited. The boy was christened “Amankar”. It harmonizes with Ramcharanji’s elder son Omkar.

Ramcharanji, Sulekhaji, Ramcharanji’s wife and Omkar were having a wonderful time with Amankar. Omkar was very much fond of his younger brother. He could not even resist having a look at him before undressing his school uniform.

Ramcharanji belonged to middle income group. He was a teacher. He was the only earning member of the family. Ramcharan and his wife always had a talk after the dinner about providing their children a good education and wisdom. They believed in simple living and high thinking.

By god blessing they were able to give their children what they yearned for. When your intention is noble, nothing can stop you.

Ramcharanji once told his children: “

”………so true but in this world will this work?

Omkar passed out from school and Amankar now grew old enough that he could memorize his childhood incidents in his later life. Amankar and his brother now had little fights. Sometimes it grew so intense that Sulekhaji had to drop in the middle. For a day at maximum, there would be no communication between them. Then again, they would get along with each other.

Sometime there were sweet fights over food. Amankar always compared the size of his fish’s piece with others, especially with Omkar. He always had a quick look at the other dishes. He would give a sweet smile if he found his one bigger and everybody would laugh out loud suddenly. Things got funnier when there were pakodas. Amankar would count the number of pakodas in every dish to check whether it was equally distributed or not. Often cunningly, he would hide some pakodas under the rice and ask, 

 Everybody could understand what has happened but kept mum to see him smile when given more.

 

Amankar was now in class six and Omkar been admitted in a government college to get a degree on life science as he was very fond of that subject. In college life, a person begins to build a life where he take his own decisions and often lose his way. However, Omkar choose the other way. He was well aware of his upbringing. Omkar had a trait of understanding an unknown person instantly. He became close to someone whom he felt right. Amankar was growing by watching his brother.

Amankar had a school life till class ten which he would regret whenever he remembers that. He could not get well along with them. The only reason was that he could not withstand show off and hypocrisy. It was something that he was unfamiliar. Amankar considers his school life at Saraswati Vidyalaya, the one that he would always feel the opposite way than the former. He enjoyed the best of his school life while studying there. As one crosses a phase, new people enter in one’s life. Amankar also had so.

He made some good friends. He met a person that shook him like an earthquake measuring 9.9 on Richter scale. He considers himself his role model. Amankar believes his ideologies blindly. One of his saying still hammer in his ear 

. No one can force someone to do something. If so, it either goes the opposite way or does for the time being only. Ultimately, the real thing pops up. The earthquake was the vice principal of the school.

Amankar completed his school life. He parted away from his two childhoods as well as school friends Aisha and Prajakta while studying at Saraswati Vidyalaya. But they had tuition together. They also shared quality times together as they were family friends.

Amankar had a friend called Paresh, who was his best pal during those ten years of regretful school life. Paresh had a keen interest in writing and obviously Amakar was the only appreciator. They shared a relationship that would never conk out.

Amankar had a keen interest in biology as his brother. He appeared for the medical entrance after passing the school. He cleared the prelims but unfortunately could not clear the final. He was very disheartened at that. For him that was the end of his wish of pursuing a career in medical field because neither his father would be able to bear the cost of private medical college nor he had the confidence of repeating a year. He also appeared for the engineering entrance, which he cleared to get admitted in a government engineering college in his state. Aman parted from Aisha, Prajakta and Paresh during his college life as they went outside their home state to get their degree. But they were still in contact.

Most of Aman’s friends from Saraswati Vidyalaya joined him in the same college but were in different branches. Aman got admitted to civil engineering branch. Omkar, his brother, was now in the final year of his masters.

 Aug 2004, first day in college: Aman was little nervous. Things got worse when he was terrified by hearing about the ragging done by the seniors. But Amankar managed to go to college. Everybody spoke little to each other, as they were new. Aman somehow passed the first half of the first day in college. The first year campus was separate from the other for the ragging issue. Aman went to canteen and was having his food with his school friends and some new friends when he heard a group of first year students talking about how they were ragged when they were roaming outside the campus. Amankar’s ears rose up as high as Eiffel tower. The first year campus felt like a storehouse of fresh tender meat and the lions roaming outside planning to get hold over the storage.

As it was first day, the classes were over earlier. Suddenly from nowhere, a group of seniors raged through the classroom door like bulls. Everybody gave a standing applause. Sorry, the applause part was missing. They were speaking garbage and beating the desks to sicken the scenario more. Everybody was standing as if their backbone were broken and their head hanging down. Suddenly two sounds were heard. It seemed somebody was slapped hard. But no one dared to raise their head to see what happened. Girls were trembling. A girl named Sania even broke into tears as one senior teased her. Suddenly some security guards entered into the classroom and the seniors vanished. Everybody took a deep breath of relief. Sania really saved that day.

Ragging, classes, canteen masti, hostel masti….. Became like a routine. Aman became friend with some of the students who came from other states. First year passed like that.

Second year gave the feeling of “being senior” to Aman. Some of his friends were now busy in ragging the juniors. However, Aman was busy in something else. He fell in love. Guess who? Sania…..No way. The girl saved that day but that was nothing to fall in love.

Aman fell in love with Aisha. They parted way but their telephonic conversations were getting heated up day by day. Aisha was studying fashion technology in Delhi. That was obvious as she was very good at painting and designing from childhood itself. By the time, Sunder became a good friend of Aman. Sunder came as a good guide to Aman in the form of a friend. Aman’s way of looking toward life changed wildly.

The shell around Aman shattered. He became more confident, more open minded and more outspoken. Three of his friends from outside states were closest: Sunder, Mukesh, and Anil. Sunder was in the same branch and the other two in computer science.

Sunder was best at dealing with girls and loved psychology. It helped in a great way for Aman in his love life. In that way, Sunder now became a good friend of Aisha. The second year was like Love-Aisha-Sunder cycle for Aman. The result was obvious. Both of their performance indexes went down well below their expectation.

A call came from Aman’s father asking about his result. He was almost speechless, talking in parts. His father banged the telephone receiver. That was a wireless slap on his face. However, he was surprised at how his father came to know about his result.

Aman thinking: 

favorite

Aman: 

That night Aman did not have his food and fell asleep. This was an abnormal picture. Aman could never overlook his food for whatever might be the reason.

Next day:

Ashok sir (

Aman: 

Ashok sir

Canteen:

Ashok sir: 

Aman: 

Ashok sir: See 

Aman: 

He left Aman for his class while giving a special stress on “everything”.

Aman (

): 

Aman ran to meet Sunder.

Aman: 

Sunder: 

For Aman it was hard to digest. Lately Sunder has begun practicing his psychological knowledge. Therefore, eventually he had to stoop in front of Sunder’s in depth explanation.

Third year was more sorted. Aman and Aisha restricted their chatting to nighttime only. Ashok sir’s advice really came true. Results showed that. Rahul, Aman’s school friend whom he almost forgot during his second year’s tri-cycle became one of the closest friends. Aman now became very fond of music. That was going to happen someday or other. All his family members had a keen interest in music. Therefore, that was in his blood.

Sunder and Aman also began to go long drive. Bike was managed from the seniors. They often visited Rahul’s house which was located away from the main city. There was more greenery. They found it refreshing, and the homespun food from Rahul’s house doubled that. Third year went well. Sunder and Aman again climbed the pointer tree.

During the summer break after the third year, Ashok sir sound out Aman with a proposal of working in a project work on transportation engineering. Aman at first doubted but slowly and slowly he got more curious about it as it was based on the latest technology being used. He even began to give his free time in studying it. Aman’s dedication is something that is incompetent. To Aman, everything become secondary when he indulge himself on something. Ashok sir could see the progress of the work and thought of taking it to the next level. He told Aman about having training on some of the latest software used in this field, from one of the reputed engineering colleges. Aman found it great as he could do his summer training and could also meet Aisha on the way back. Aisha and Aman often had fights as Aman was now preoccupied with the work and could not talk to her much. Aman decided to give her a surprise.

Sunder was leaving for his house in Punjab.

Aman: 

Sunder: 

Aman: 

Sunder: 

Aman: 

Aman was not surprised at Sunder, because he knew that it was fact and he has been here for two years since his admission. After second year that 

 cycle also bagged a back in solid mechanics for Sunder. So he had to do the summer classes. Truly speaking Sunder was in a mode of killing Aman for that.

Rahul decided to do training under a construction company in the college campus only. Rahul also had interest in his family business. So it was obvious.

Aman left for his summer training with Ashok sir. Aman was very much keyed up but also a bit scared. Sunder often told Aman: 

Aman was going to undergo training in such a college that he even never dreamt of entering.

Believe it or not, Aman had an experience of life time. He gathered so much knowledge and technical skill that boosted up his confidence. Aman was feeling like living in the seventh heaven. The process learning and way the scholars were leading a life there, completely changed his views upside down. Aman had one month training over there, which he would ever dare to overlook in his life. Aman completed his training and left for Delhi.

Aman’s heart beat was pounding up as he landed at the Delhi airport. This was going to be their first meet after Aman and Aisha parted. Aman had the address of Aisha’s college but it was his first time visit to Delhi. However Aman could manage a cab to reach Aisha’s college. Aman called Aisha.

Aman (

): 

Aisha: 

Aman: 

Aisha: 

Aman: 

Aisha: 

Aman: 

Aisha hanged up the call. She ran down to the college gate.

There was no Hi or Hello. Their eyes met and a watertight hug. For Aman it was like jumping in an ice pond in that blistering heat of Delhi afternoon.

Aisha: 

Aman: 

Sunder once told Aman: 

It worked.

Aisha: 

In the mean time the guard at the gate called both them.

Guard (

): 

Aisha (

):  

Aman felt like as if someone was now sprinkling salt along with this blistering heat. Aisha could feel that and wanted to laugh out loud. But she managed a small one. The guard didn’t detect that. Aisha filled the register at the guard office and they went straight to the college canteen.

Aisha: 

Aman: 

Aisha: 

Aman: 

Aisha ordered two veg thali. They sat on a corner table in the canteen.

Aisha: 

Aman: 

Aisha: 

Aman: 

Aisha: 

Their conversation continued while having the lunch. Girls always like to have the commanding position in any kind of discussion. The boys should listen and respond only at the intervals. Aman was doing so. Aman was about to finish the chutney, suddenly

Aisha: 

Aman couldn’t wait and replied: 

Aisha: 

Aman: 

The canteen chitchat lasted till evening as Aisha’s friends joined them.

Girls’ hostels had a rule that 

. Aman and Aisha had a long walk hand in hand before that rule came into active mode. Aman stayed at the guest hostel.

Aman spent the next day in shopping. But not of his will. Aisha was the bargain hunter and Aman the carter. She had a long list. Girls are just irresistible to it. Thanks to god, Aman got a tinge of it during the canteen tête-à-tête. Therefore, he booked a ticket in 

beforehand. Finally the list was over. Aman’s hands were encumbered to their utmost capacity. They were exhausted. Nevertheless, Amsan had a silly smile on his face. Boys hate to show their infirmity in front of girls.

They returned as far as the girls’ hostel rules are concerned. But three cheers to mobile phones. They talked till late night.

As predicted, they were late to reach the station. But thanks to Indian railway, it runs a little late. It was not at all a dreary journey for Aman. The two lovebirds were oozing with love. The lustrous view of the nature doubled it up. Aman and Aisha were standing near the door. Aman kissed Aisha caringly. Aisha did not hang back.

The journey will remain as an eternal memory of love for them.

Summer holidays were over. Aisha left for Delhi. Aman was now in final year: It was all about project. Subject pressures were less. Aman and Sunder climbed enough to get Ashok sir as their project guide. Rahul also joined them.

Their project was based on transportation engineering. Ashok sir was doing some research on travel demand modelling. So he gave a part of his research work as their project. Aman was very much excited about that, because he had worked earlier on that subject.

Ashok sir gave a briefing of the work they have to perform. They basically had to do travel survey, analyse the data and provide the output for interpretation. Aman had a trait of embracing one’s proficient side. So he was the best to know how to accomplish the work.

Sunder was competent in staging or enacting. So he was given the documentation and the presentation part. Rahul was involved in their family business; he knew how to deal with different kind of people. He was given the responsibility of conducting the survey. Rahul evidently looked upon the expenditure of the project, as neither Sunder nor Aman could provide the cheapest plan of executing a work as well as Rahul. Aman kept the design and analyzing part with him.

They had a marvelous time together during their project work. The project acted as an adhesive between them. They became more acquainted with each other. The project added a new dimension to their friendship.

Best men were taking care of the works that they find irresistible. So the harvest had to be golden. The faculties were dumbstruck by their performance. The challenging work was highly appreciated. This hard work also credited to their respective pointer. All three of them took a step ahead of the sixes they were hitting for the past three years.

The two small jumps were completed. A party deserved. Nothing could be better than Rahul’s house. Rahul’s parents were out of station. They went to attend a family ceremony. So it was like a road without any speed limit. They enjoyed to the zenith point that a bachelor party can ever have.

They scored enough to sit for the placement. But things were a little twisted. Sunder was bit more interested in software than civil engineering. He got placed in a leading IT/Software company. Rahul wanted a job in his own state so that look after his family business along with his job. He got job in a construction company in his state.

Things did not go Aman’s way. Aman was a transparent person. But things work differently in corporate world. So he failed in that field. Aman broke down badly. Evidently, Aman’s family was a little upset. His father was now retired. Omkar got job in a private company after completing the masters.

Aman was empty-headed. He was puzzled at what to opt for. However, destiny had other plans for Aman. Aman applied for a leading research organization that was working in a domain related to their project work. Aman was chosen as the research intern post. The third jump was not yet over. As per as the game is concerned it is a much longer jump then the other two.

Five years have passed. Aman is now the youngest technical adviser to Transport minister, Government of India. He is married to Aisha. They now live in Delhi.

The voice startled me. I hopped up from the sofa.

Me: 

Dr. Mehta: 

Me: 

Aman: 

Aman has come to Mumbai for some office work. We had facebook chatting regularly but didn’t meet for a long time.

Aman saw my notebook.

Aman: 

Aman still loves my writings. Even in his busy schedule, he keeps an update of my every work.

Me: 

As usual, Aman could not say no to that. Aman and I left for the lunch…………
