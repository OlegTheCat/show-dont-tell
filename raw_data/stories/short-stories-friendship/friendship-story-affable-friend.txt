“They both walked in a very quiet cool moon road”..Smrithi….Talk to me..Kalpana…..She left me….Do i dont deserve her???I really  

 her..I Just want to be with her,She feels I dont enjoy life..I always live with rules..She didnt liked to be with me.. I let here go..But i cant move on..She was an amazing friend…….

Smrithi….You dont have to move on…Just be yourself…you’ll get her back soon..Maybe she’s too missing you…

I don’t feel so..I really want her back.Smrithi….

Vaishali holded her hands….,come on…You’re good at what you truly love…Everthing going to be alright..

Smrithi..Vaishali called after a long gap…

You don’t like to get married???
