This is the story about two girls staying in the hostel. Now-a-days, people think that students live a freely life in the hostel but this is not always be true. Sometimes students wants to live in the hostel to study and built their career which is shown in my story.

Radhika and Asha were the studying in the college and sharing the same room in the hostel. Radhika was from Chennai whereas Asha was from Delhi. Both the girls were belonged to lower-middle class family whereas mostly girls belonged to Upper-middle class and rich families.

One day , the hostel girls decided to go to their homes in winter vacations but both Radhika and Asha didn’t want to go back to their homes. All the hostel girls were surprised and asked the reason.

Radhika replied “I am from a joint family. After the expiration of my mother in a road accident, my father has sent me in the hostel to study and make my career otherwise my grandmother and other relatives will try to discontinue my studies and make me married. My father wants to make me educated and well settled in my career.”

After that, Asha told “I am an orphan child. After the death of my parents and brother, my maternal uncle and aunt are my guardians but they treated me like a burden. As an adult, I am the only legal heir of my parents money and property, so they cannot take anything from me forcefully. That’s why I have no parental house in reality”.

All the girls felt sorry to hear the circumstances which were raised in their life and very necessary for hostel stay for Radhika and Asha. They decided that they will bring both of them to their homes in holidays to make them understand that they are not alone in their life and create a family environment as they are staying away from their house in the hostel like a family.
