 from 

In the great kingdom of Magadhat there were three friends named Harsh, Krishna and Ravi. Harsh was the son of king of Magadha. Krishna was the son of a priest and Ravi was the son of the king’s minister.

The three were good friends. They grew up together and spent all their childhood in each other’s company. However how good they were economically, all of them were lazy and good for nothing. Their fathers always persuaded them to mend their ways but all their attempts were in vain. The three friends were lethargic too.

One day the three met and discussed their conditions at home. The three decided to leave their home. Suddenly Harsh came up with an idea.

He said,”Friends, I’ve heard that in a hill nearby there are a lot of gems. We can climb the hill and collect the gems, then we won’t have to work for the whole life.”

The idea was accepted and the three friends decided to leave at once. After a hard climb , they collected the gems and started to leave. It was late night. All of them were aware of the robbers at night at those hills. So they started walking cautiously back to their homes. Suddenly a band of robbers surrounded them and asked them to give them all their gems.

Harsh said,”If you want any gem, then you will have to fight me.”

After saying that he signalled his friend to go back and call the soldiers. Ravi and Krishan ran from the spot leaving their friend. After sometimes when they came back, they saw their friend lying in a pool of blood. They realised what happened and gave their friend a salute who has saved their life.

 A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED.
