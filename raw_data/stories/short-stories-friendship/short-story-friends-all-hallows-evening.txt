Marcelle – Halloween Short Story

My name is Marcelle and it’s Halloween today. I’m just going to write down what happened. I was home alone and we were seven people here, my girlfriend, my two friends, a friend’s girlfriend, a friend of my girlfriend and a friend of my friend’s girlfriend. We had some sort of a Halloween party, and watching horror movies.

Our first kiss was at the movies. The plan was to kiss her, it would be my first kiss. After having waited far too much into the first movie I finally had to, after some time with incredible suspense I still had a long way to go. But on the bright side, then I was a little closer to her. Amazing to be that close to her, she almost didn’t turn her face at all when she then gave me a quick glance with a subtle spontaneous smile. Then I went for it and she turned her face to me, then more slow and with my head tilted to the right I got closer and closer, eventually my mouth touched her lips.

My girlfriend was wearing a skeleton dress and our muscle cars were parked outside, mine is black with white stripes. I had to pay for new paint and stripes in order to get her to date me. she was very specific. that was last year.

The whole gang went out back to the backyard, which I wasn’t. With all my family’s life jackets on and out in the dark cold water, they went less loud as they began floating on their backs and drinking even more.

I have been a fan of her because she was really an under cover movie star but didn’t tell anyone. So I had pictures of her on the walls but didn’t think about that it was her. I was like so surprised because we have like seen the movies she is in. I think she is a so cool star. We are going to go to parties with movie stars.
