Once upon a time there were three friends named Ali, Hamza and Sara. They were very close friends. They lived in a backward area called Palawan . But they were very happy with their lives. Everyday they used to play in the street from 6 o’clock to 7 o’clock .

In Palawan near their house was a giant house which was named as “Temple of death” by the people. Because for long no body lived in their but each night came the voices of laughter and talks which horrified the people of Palawan and people thought it was the voice of ghosts so nobody dared to go in. One day while the three of them were playing in the street their ball went in to that house. Ali said come and fetch the ball and play again but Sania was much scared so she said I won’t go.

But afterwards she accepted to go with them . Ali saw his father coming so he said we will go in at night. At night the three of them were out at the back of the house, they used the ladder to climb in, they were searching for their ball then they heard those voices.  Sania was scared and she fainted. Ali and Hamza went to search the balcony where they saw a light on and cries of a young boy. While they were searching Hamza slipped his feet and fell on the stairs,  he could clearly see some kidnappers with a boy.

In the mean time Ali said” Hamza I got the ball”.

Hamza said “look down”

Than Ali and Hamza both carried Sania out of the house. In morning Ali’s uncle who was a police man, visited their house. Ali told him about the house. His uncle raided the house and caught the kidnappers .

Ali was rewarded by his uncle and now the three of them play in that house. The house is no more haunted.
