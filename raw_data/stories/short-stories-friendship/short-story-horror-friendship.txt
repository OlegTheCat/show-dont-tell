My mobile phone rang loudly. I was tensed that who was calling me at midnight 12. But I thought it might be some emergency call. I picked up the phone. The person on the opposite side of the call was familiar to me. I said her hello and started the conversation but realized soon that it was indeed an emergency call. I heard what the other person over the phone said and turned pale. I was horror stricken. I was continuously sweating and I was not able to move even a single part of my whole body.

I sat down on the sofa and tried to analyze what had happened.

I was alone in my house since my parents were out for a wedding party. Three hours back I had called my best friend to come in my house. I always used to spend some quality time with my friend when I was alone. My and my friend’s house is usually a 5 minutes way. But today, he took one hour to reach my house. I asked him several times why he was late but he did not reply. I remember I teased him being laziest parson in this world. But yet soon I forgot about it and till now I have spent some two hours with him and now it was 12 midnight.

Me and my friend were having a walk in our terrace and having some gossips. It was then that the phone rang suddenly. My friend said casually to promise him that I will come back to him as soon as possible. I did not took this promise seriously and thought he was just saying this because he was afraid to be alone in the terrace during such a calm night. i hurried and picked up the phone. It was my friend’s mother. She informed me that my best friend had died two hours ago due to an accident.

Now I was seated in my sofa trying to decide that whether to go upstairs or to the hospital to complete the last promise which I gave to my friend.

I was shocked and very sad. Tears rolled down my face and I was continuously perspiring thinking that I had spent two hours with a friend who was dead.
