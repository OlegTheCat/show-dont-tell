[Its one of THOSE days – Poem for Friend]

Its one of those days,

 When you really feel low…

 Like a dark cloud is overshadowing your inner glow..

Its one of those days,

 When you feel its a test..

 Like a bird in the forest..searching her nest ..

Its one of those days..

 When nothing seems right..

 The illuminous moon..doesn’t brighten the night..

Its one of those days ,

 When it seems no one cares..

 Like you are alone in a crowd, far from everywhere..

Its one of those days ,

 When you need your true friends..

 To tell you that GREAT days are ahead..this is not the END ..!

 Whatever happens, they will be with you –

 Treasure such Friends..they are Rare and Few !!
