Family Short Story – Sam

 from 

Sam L. Jackson JR ,that’s my name, most people that I know with such a name were all white, dressed in beach shirts, short pants and sandals, just like daddy,Mr Sam L Jackson, but I was more like mommy ,or most of what I know of her.

Daddy ,mommy said I should refer to him as Mr Jackson, I would always ask why but never really got the answer I was looking for but only that “airplanes take idiots to hell”, nevertheless , Mr. Jackson wasn’t dead at all ,if he was then hell had good phone reception and it prefers Mr. Jackson not talking to mommy, every time he calls that is.

“Yes”, I love swimming , but not depths though, nor sitting at the back of music class, I wasn’t that much of a tall student, and too short to be class bully, “no”, I don’t like musical instruments, the subject its too hard or less visible from my perspective, but I like the cushions at the back of the class though and besides who likes school anyways?.

The fun part is probably when its Thomas’s birthday, we all love his cake ,he was far too mean to get any happy birthday wishes from me, but the cake, I was willing to work for it, so I would join in on the singing.

It my birthday today as you know , that’s why you’re here , I hope you enjoy my piece of the cake , the class said it was good, so enjoy it, the fun part for me was the presents today, like you, Sam, or I should probably call you blue rapper ,or maybe 9th birthday.

The sender must have sent u off in a hurry because I cant really make out the note attached to you, but the word “Sam” was good enough for my eyes. Maybe it was too cold where you came from, you know, since polar bears like the cold and ohh the sender was shaking when he wrote the note , but anyways will you say hit to him for me when mommy sends you back, I don’t know why she returning you, but she’s too annoyed for me to ask, but hey atleast you’ll get to be back in the cold again, where it is good for you.
