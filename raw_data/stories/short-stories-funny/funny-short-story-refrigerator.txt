Funny Short Story – Refrigerator

Married men should never complain or as they say do so in silence from the prying eyes of their wives.

We finally thought of getting rid of our old refrigerator.yes, the one my mom had for the last 15 years. Family is growing and 185 litres of space is not worth anymore also it doesn’t compete much with neighbor’s 250 liters brand new double door.

Economy Zone was my first preference because I got my first 32 inch TV of lesser known brand at a price half than those of the well known brand but again I was a bachelor then but the status has changed four months ago.

There it was beautiful 250 liters of pure awesomeness at only Rs 17,000 with 3 star rating and I so fell in love that the color did not matter to me much. I was looking at the price tag she was looking at the color, maroon was her color.

Being from a middle class background we are taught to buy things cheap and best even if it does not exactly match the color you are looking for. So here again my middle class mentality kicked in hard.

My wife resisted because it was not maroon but I coaxed her. Little did I know that this is going to become my Achilles’ heel.

The product was delivered next day and I was content but my wife was not. Steel grey still bothered her so much that she skipped lunch and that gave me the indication that something was wrong upon cloud number 9.

Finally, she lost her cool and Steel Grey was not the color anymore.
