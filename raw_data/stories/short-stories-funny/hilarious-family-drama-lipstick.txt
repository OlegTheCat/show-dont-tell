 from 

: Aren’t you going a little early, today?

: Yes, dear, got a meeting with a client. Bye, honey.

: Okay, bye, sweetheart.

(Two days later)

(Thinks aloud) Sarang is still in the bathroom. What do I do? I’ll see what it is.

 (Whispers to herself) There is an SMS. It is from someone by name Bhanupriya. It reads, 

 Oh my God! What’s going on?

(The following week)

 Hello.

Hello. May I speak to Sarang?

 (Wonders) 

? (Speaks aloud) He hasn’t yet returned from office. Who is this?

 Tell him Bhanupriya called. Have him call me, please.

 (Hesitatingly) Okay. I’ll tell him.

: Thanks.

(The next day)

: (Thinks aloud) A woman’s handkerchief! It’s rather old, crumpled, and faded. What is this? A faded maroon smear? It is definitely the lipstick imprint of a woman’s lips! So, our marriage of seven years has come to this! I must do something. Too early to confront him. Let me gather more information.

 We are known for our … ah … discretion, madam. He will not get even a … ah … whiff of what is going on. Our investigators will be … ah … invisible. 

: Here’s the advance you asked for, balance, after conclusion of the assignment.

 Thanks, madam; I’ll contact you in … ah … a few days.

(Nandini nods and leaves.)

: Okay, Bhanu, I’ll get along; getting late; will keep in touch.

: Bye, Sarang, see you next time.

: Bye.

(Two days later)

: (Talking to himself) Hmmm…The case file is ready. This completes the assignment; spent a week on this. I’ll handover this folder to the boss. Bye-bye Mrs. Nandini.

(The next day)

Mahalingam is smiling)

: Why are you smiling like a Cheshire cat? I don’t find this funny.

: Sorry, madam.

: So, my husband doesn’t know about … this …

: I told you, we are quite … ah … efficient and … ah … discreet.

: All right, Mr. Mahalingam, here’s the balance of your fees.

: 

 madam.

: 

***

 

: (Thinks aloud) Yes, I must. I don’t have a choice.

: Darling, are you going somewhere?

: 

: Sweetheart, are you …

: (Viciously) Cut the bullshit, Sarang.

: Darling, honey … what’s wrong? What happened? Where are you going?

: To my parents’.

: Why so suddenly? Are they okay?

: They won’t be, when they hear what I have to say.

: Wh … what …ddo you … you mean, dear? I don’t understand.

: You will, soon.

: Here comes my cab. Bye, Sarang. You will hear from me, and don’t follow me or call me tonight.

: Will you have some coffee or tea, son?

: No, I don’t want anything. I didn’t go to office. I didn’t sleep the whole night. I called Nandu dozens of times but she wouldn’t answer. I am going crazy. Did she tell you anything?

: No, she didn’t speak to me or her father.

: She is in her room. Why don’t you go … and sort it out with her? If you need any help …

: I’ll do that.

: Shut the door, Sarang.

: What is it, Nandu darling? Why did you come away leaving me all alone?

: (Angrily) Don’t you know? Really?

: What, tell me?

: (In ice-cold voice) Who is Bhanupriya?

: Bhanupriya … ha, ha, ha … is that what’s bothering you?

: You are laughing, you bas**rd! Who is she? Since when is this going on?

: She is my childhood friend … hey … what do you mean how long? What do you 

 is going on?

: I don’t 

, Mr. Sarang, I 

. Now, tell me, honestly, at least now.

: Are you crazy? Nothing is going on. We were classmates until high school. We parted ways for college and jobs. We met after a decade when she came to our office on business …

: Whose?

: What do you mean whose? Whose what?

: Business.

: Yes business.

: That’s what I asked. Whose?

: Oh…oh… You mean whose business? Of course hers…wait…it isn’t what you think. She is a good married woman …

: Of course, you’d say that …

: Oh…don’t interrupt…where was I?

: Meeting her on 

.

: Yes…no…okay. She came to submit some quotation to our tender inquiry. She asked for the Sales Manager and she was brought to me. I was surprised to see her after so many years, after high school, you see.

: You must have been very happy at meeting her.

: Yes…no…God, it isn’t like that. Of course, we were happy to meet after so many years, after high school, you see.

: Will you leave the high school and get into the college, ever?

: I was coming to that but you are interrupting again and again.

: When was this … 

?

: About two months ago. Hey, wait don’t use expressions like that…

…and all. We just met, that’s all.

: You just met…hmmm…only once?

: Yes…no…on that day only once.

: Oh God…so, afterwards, you met her more than once in a day?

: Yes…no, no, no. We met a few times … only on business, mind you.

: Of course…officially…right?

: Officially.

: Had lunch…es?

: Officially.

: In hotels…Taj Coromandel…

: Officially.

: And hugged each other?

: Officially,

: Hey, Nandu, that’s not what I wanted to say.

: The truth comes out, at last. So, 

 wasn’t official.

: No. I mean, yes. God, I am going crazy. We were old friends. We just hugged, that’s all, , after high school, you see, just as you would hug your friends, too.

: True, but I wouldn’t send cryptic SMSs or have secret 

 or …

: Hey, it is true, I didn’t tell you about her but there was nothing to it. We had to meet on official business a few times. She sent SMSs about the place and time, that’s all.

: Nothing?

: Yes, nothing?

: She didn’t give you a gift, a very 

 gift to you?

: No.

: A long time ago?

: Long time ago? I met her just two months ago, after high school, you see. What personal gift are you talking about?

: Very personal gift … a loving gift, actually.

: Loving … God …I’ve  always loved you and only you, Nandu. You know that.

: I thought so, too, until recently.

: Until recently? What do you mean? You think I don’t love you anymore?

: Any doubt about that?

: No.

: No?

: I mean no doubt that I love you…I mean I love you and no doubt about that.

: You are lying. You are having an affair with this…this…high school friend of yours…this Bhanupriya or whatever.

: Not whatever, dear.…

.

: And now, grammar lessons, too!

: I was just saying.

: This affair must have started long ago…years ago…right?

: No, no, no … you are wrong, not years ago.

: Started 

, you mean?

: No, no, no…again you are wrong, not recently.

: Not long ago; not recently; so since when?

: Since…

, darling.

: Can you prove it?

: Hey, how can anyone prove it?

: Not 

; 

.

: I?

: Yes, you.

: Okay, I.

: So? Prove it.

: Prove what?

: What you said earlier.

: What did I say earlier?

: That you never had any affair with Bhanupriya.

: Hey, how can anyone prove it; I mean how can I prove it? You accused me; you prove it.

: Really?

: You can’t because there wasn’t any.

: Do you want me to? I can, you see. I have the report and photographs from a PI; photographic evidence.

: You had a 

 shadow me? And what’s this about 

? Why do you need 

?

: For divorce proceedings, what else!

: Divorce? Oh my god, what are you saying, Nandu? Divorce from whom?

: Of course from 

. I am married 

.

: I know. But why? I never had any affair with her or anyone else. You can’t prove it.

: (Murmurs) It looks kind of familiar.

: Of course, it would. That’s 

 handkerchief. That’s 

 lipstick. Those are 

 lips. Right, Mr. Sarang?

: Maybe. How would I know? How did you get it? Did she give it to you?

: She gave it to 

.

: Me? What gives you the idea?

: I found it in 

, Sarang.

: 

!

: Yes, 

 dresser…bottommost drawer. QED. That was when your affair with her started, didn’t it?

: Ha, ha, ha … you dolt … ha, ha, ha.

: Now, what drama are you enacting?

: Ha, ha, ha …

: Have you gone mad?

: (ROFL. ROFL. ROFL. Literally.)

: Sarang, Sarang…are you mad? What has gotten into you? Get up.

: My lovable fool, my adorable dolt, this handkerchief is not 

.

: You are lying.

: I am not.

: Then, how was it in your dresser?

: Because (he pauses for dramatic effect) it is 

.

: Mine?

: Yours; you gave it to me.

: How? When?

: Do you remember the days when we were engaged, for nearly six months?

: (Cautiously) Yyyyes.

: Do you remember that evening? In the park? You and I?

(About seven years ago.)

: I love you, my sweetie pie, my peach, my Tom Cruise. I am sorry, darling.

: It’s okay, dear, but please don’t ever give me an encore of it.

: Never… Hmmm … So, what are you waiting for?

: What?

: Come to Nandu, darling.

: Dinner was out of the world, Nandu. You are an awesome cook.

: Thanks, Bhanu. Please visit us again.

: Sure, Nandu. You, too.

: Definitely.

: You can hug each other, you know,
