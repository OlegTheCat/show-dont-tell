There was exhilarating freshness in the breeze of the sunny day. I was out in the city park with the group of my friends. We were sitting on the grass and our shoes were lying nearby and we were barefooted. A figure with a black dress caught my attention. She was in a dark black dress, dark blue shaded specs and maybe of 32-34 years old. She was looking at every person in the park. I told my friends and the agreed to check out what it actually was.

Looking at her dress-up and the way she behaved, we came to a result that she must be a thief and soon it was proved. A man, at whom she was looking at continuously, went to the washroom visible nearby. She suddenly went at the bench where the man was sitting and picked up a handbag which the man had left. We were speechless for a second. Before we could shout, she ran away from there.

Even today I wonder where she disappeared from the park. Certain things happened for a few days. We’d everyday go there to see her. Then we decided that we’d get her caught by the police. We moved on to the police station and asked them to come with us the very next day.

The police were ready and the time came, 5:12 pm and the evening did its magic. The woman came, and we showed it to the police officer. They were ready with their equipments. We were hiding ourselves behind some old trees and bushes. As soon as the woman came nearer, the police pounced on her and got her caught. She patiently showed the police an I-card and seeing this, the police stepped back. We were astonished and hence I peeped on the Identity card and I also stepped towards home shamefully, seeing only few words…

The words were something like “Central Board of Intelligence and Detective Forces”…
