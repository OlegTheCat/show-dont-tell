 Life is going well. I am enjoying at my office and learning new things. I am happy that finally I have got what I wanted from so long…

7.00 PM

 While heading back to home I decided to enjoy a meal outside

 I called up Rohan and forced him to come with me.

 In love with Noodles, I said while ordering Schewaan Hongkong Noodles

8.15 PM

 Finally, the wait is over. I got it. First bite 

, second bite 

, third bite 

, fourth bite 

, fifth bite and …………………boooooommm

I am feeling dizzy….everything is ghoooooming ghoooooming and more ghoooming…. eyes are dancing…..

 I am not able to open my eyes. But I can hear that Rohan is trying to make me conscious. Someone is sprinkling water…someone is shifting fan towards me.

Finally, I am back but what the hell.. I don’t remember anything

 I am waiting for Ria. Ohh!! There she is the hungry dinosaur. I was hungry too, so ordered my all time favourite Paneer Tikka.

Few minutes later

 When she was perfectly fine, I hired a cab, dropped her near home and asked her to take care of herself.
