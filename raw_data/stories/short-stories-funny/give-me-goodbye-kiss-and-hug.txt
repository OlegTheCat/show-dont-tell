Funny Short Story – Give me Goodbye Kiss and Hug – Funny Short Story

[This funny short story was told to me by my neighbour and friend.]

My friend Shipra and her husband Rahul went to a party with the kids. They have 2 kids. There were friends and friend’s friends at party. Every body was having good time and enjoying. Finally, it was time to leave. One family, to who they met in that party first time, was about to leave. The lady of that family was showing off more than friendly behaviour, telling bye to each and every person present there especially kids. She came to Shipra and Rahul also.  She said very loudly with great affection,

“Ok Rahul, now it is time to say bye, come and give me a kiss and hug.”

There was a sudden silence, mix with shock, and then everybody burst out laughing when they came to know she meant Rahul’s son and not Rahul. (The lady got confused between Rahul’s and his son’s name.)

She turned red with embrassment and ran out from the spot making others laugh even louder. Rahul was also smiling but feeling embarrassed. Until today everyone teases Rahul. And that lady — she avoids facing Rahul and doubly ensures the name before saying bye :-)
