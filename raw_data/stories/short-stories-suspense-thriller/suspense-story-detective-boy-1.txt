Once upon a time, in a city there was a boy named Ashwin. He has forgotten his important note books in his class on Friday. He had the exam from the same note book. SO he went to the school on Sunday to bring back his note book. He took special permission from School security to enter the classroom. Since it was holiday and so there was no one in his classroom. When he entered the classroom he saw that the computer of his classroom was missing there. He saw some footprints and he followed them.

The footprints stopped in the front of the window. Then he thought that the thief has jumped from the window. Then he also jumped from the window and got his legs hurt. He saw the same footprint that he saw in the classroom.

 He followed them. Then he saw the thief who was going in a car. Then he noted the car number. He ran to catch the car but he can’t.

Then he ran to the police station and told police the whole story. He gave the car no to police.Then he also searched for the thief. He was on the main road, he saw the car of the thief but it was red light so he can’t go. Then he went home.

When he was going to bed he thought how to catch the thief. Then the next day he again went to find the thief. Then he again saw the same car of the thief which was parked outside an old bungalow. Then he went inside the bungalow. He heard some noise from the upstairs. So he went upstairs in a room. The voice was coming from there. He saw the thief; he saw he was talking to someone. He was talking to sell the computers.

Where Ashwin was hiding there was a gun, mobile phone and a rope. First he called the police in the bungalow. Then he shot on the thief and the person he was talking to. Then he binds them with the rope. Then the police came and arrested them. Then one police said thanks Ashwin.

After some days he got the bravery award. After that everyone said him The Detective Boy.
