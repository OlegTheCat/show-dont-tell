Suspense Short Story – The Monster in the Alley

“Something is missing”, I say to no one. “Something is wrong…”

Though as hard as I try, I can’t place the absence. It’s on the tip of my tongue but somehow out of reach…

As I look around, I notice suddenly that there truly is 

around me, which is honestly starting to scare me a bit… it’s dim, and I can hear the faint sounds of people, but no one is here. The moon is a cold, bright crescent in the night sky. There’s absolutely nothing here but the cold ground and the black above me, the stars seeming to be the only form of life, the abandoned buildings that I’m sure were once filled with life but somehow ended up being vacant – cold and empty, much like my lungs become as I stare at what lies before me…

On the cold, hard ground about 7 feet in front of me, I see it, writhing on the floor in what looks to be extreme pain, making a sound I have never heard before, nor I’m sure has anyone else. The sound of pain, or torture, the sound an animal might make if it were being skinned alive…but this doesn’t resemble anything like the animals around here.

Suddenly I get a strong feeling that it’s a setup, that this creature is baiting me, waiting for my sympathy to overcome my fear. Before the creature can get up, before he can chase me, I run down the street past it. It screams at me, and for a second I catch a glimpse of red eyes before I turn the corner, panting, wondering what just happened in that abandoned street…
