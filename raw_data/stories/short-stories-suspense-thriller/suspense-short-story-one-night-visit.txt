Photo credit: 

 from 

That night was special,,special because I was watching a romance sequence on t.v., a nice one,,,my brother was studying in his room…it was dark since the electricity went out,,so I was using inverter …My mother usually scolds me for using inverter to watch t.v,,,but that night I was really lucky because she went out for some work related to office……

Ah!,i was relieved that I’m not gonna miss the episode this time..but gosh my luck,,suddenly i heard her voice calling to open the backdoor which i have to lock  for safety purpose,,,and hence I jumped from the bed ,,pulled the cable out,,,and with extra safety,,,while cleaning all this mess,,i saw the dark shadow of my brother running towards the door,,,and so i shouted,,”please ,wait!”,,,

and then I ran towards him,,,and was relieved because he was just standing there without any motion,,,and then i thanked God and slowed down my speed,,,and asked him to open it then,,,but then also he was standing motionless and was actually blocking the door,,,,it was dark,,and so it was difficult to see him,,,which was making me feel uneasy,,,,

so I went near him,,and asked ,,”how long are you going to stand like that?”,,

but then also there was no answer,,,,,,,,which made me angry,,so I shouted and tried to beat him,,,but then I realized that there was no one,,the corridor was empty ,,..there was no one beside me,……….I took the courage and moved forward and opened the door,,..

My mother started shouting at me, but I had no answer ,,I was so amazed or its better to say that I was too shocked to handle the situation…………,,then i ran towards my brothers room and asked him about the situation,,,and his answer was “NO”..

Who was that person ? Did someone come to visit me?

Don’t know,,but that one night visit ,,I really can’t forget!!!
