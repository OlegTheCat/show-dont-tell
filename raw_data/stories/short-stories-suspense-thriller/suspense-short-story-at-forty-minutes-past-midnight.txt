Ashutosh awakened with sheer suddenness. He felt his death running down his spine. He drank some water from the glass beside. The television set was still on and he could not remember when he had fallen asleep on the sofa. He found his favourite  horror movie playing on the channel, At forty minutes past midnight where the death of the victim occurs when his car fails at a graveyard’s gate, and upon being chased by an unknown entity, he tries to escape but at last is killed, and the movie continues in next birth belief where the protagonist is reborn and blah blah blah. Victory for good at last. It was the nineteenth time he was watching, and why shouldn’t he fall asleep? He understood that the movie had got the better of him. He switched off the TV and before going to sleep, he checked the time. It was: FORTY MINUTES PAST MIDNIGHT!

 

for dream every is a gift not,

if dream may bring an angel down,

can it not bring a disease foul?
