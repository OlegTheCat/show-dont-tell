 from 

He was in bed … Total relief swept him …he thanked his stars dat it was but only a delusion … A phantasma and perhaps d worst one could ever have ……… Yes  it was .. until d very next second when he found his hands sodden … Drenched in a scarlet trail oozing out and finding it means out of a deep fissure in his neck ……he fell out into a blood-curdling scream which filled the cherry hued sky and the crimson street …..Tears rolled down his cadaverous eyes as if he had ripped up a giant cacti or a crumb of hemming and mushrooming venomous ivy ………… !!!!!!!
