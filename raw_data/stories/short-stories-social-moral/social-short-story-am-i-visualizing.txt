This is a small incident that took place a few months back and has left me stunned. Read and do tell me, ‘Am i visualizing?’

I was on my way home with my younger brother when I saw a girl dressed poorly, walking down the lane all alone. I accidentally looked into her eye and it was then when I noticed pain, pain as if she had cried for years.I tried stopping her but she just walked away.

I have seen many people crying and many swollen red eyes but the pain I saw in her eyes was different. I thought about her all day and night almost for a week.

The next day, I asked my brother that does he remember the girl we saw a week back?  But he answered that he didn’t see any girl that day or probably he was busy in his phone so he didn’t notice.

This made me feel restless and I could not stop myself go back & enquire about her.

But, I got nothing. Nobody knew her. I felt as if I am chasing a dream, something unreal.

‘I must have visualized someone’

A few days later I saw her again. I ran towards her, blocked her way & looked straight into her eyes to ask all questions I had in mind. But before I could ask anything, her eyes caught all my attention.

She had beautiful eyes. Deep & dark. Her eyes were like a story. A story of a lake. Calm, seamless but lonely.

I looked closely,

I saw fear too.

I could make out what others couldn’t.

I asked, 

, her voice choked with emotions.

She looked away. Her eyes were moving at random directions but not towards me.

I just kept looking at her, trying to make an eye contact again.

She smiled. And then walked away. I could see her walking but just stood silent.

I don’t know where she went.
