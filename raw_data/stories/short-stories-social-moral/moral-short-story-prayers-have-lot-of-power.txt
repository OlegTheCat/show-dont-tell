A mother and a child were residents of a remote place, they went to a garden to play, they were so lost in playing that they didn’t realize that the garden was connected to a deep jungle and there was a board which said “WILD ANIMALS AHEAD, DANGEROUS TO GET IN”, that they had accidentally ignored and crossed, by the time they realized it, it was night and pitch dark, they didn’t knew which side they had to go and what had to be done.

The only thing they could do is pray, and the only prayer they knew was “OH LORD ALMIGHTY PLEASE BE WITH US, HELP US AND GUIDE US”, suddenly they saw a tribal man who led them back to their cottage safely. Mother and child realized the power of prayer, and never left praying ever.

Then one day, the woman lost her husband in a terrible train accident, she didn’t knew what to do, her life had no purpose and she wanted to commit suicide, but then when she was just about to intake poison, her son stopped her and said, “Mother,why don’t we go and live in the jungle with those tribal people and do something for them?” her son was a grown up now and he said, “mom this is what god told me in my dreams, when I was praying in silence”.

Suddenly his mother hugged him, and found a purpose to her life, she went to the jungle, stayed with the tribal people, and educated them to earn a decent living. However another tragedy happened, as if they were living just to cry and struggle always, and that was, the jungle was completely destroyed by a sudden fire and all the people had died except them, and there was dead silence with no one around and then they prayed, mother by then knew all the herbs and had thorough knowledge of all good fertilizers and chemicals there, she, with the help of government opened a huge herbal center and lived happily every after and they never ever missed praying in-spite of all their busy schedule, because that was the only thing which never left them, and gave them a lot of encouragement and support.
