Social Short Story – WHERE DREAMS ARE TAKING ME…????

Its a happy day as my 12th exams are finished. Now I have a lots of dreams which I have to fulfill. First I will go for English classes for my further studies in New Zealand . My family is not with me in this idea of going abroad. I always thing about that country as I want to become famous personality. I do prayers to *GOD* and finally my parents agree

Now I will go to English classes. I do my best in exam of English . I get good scores and now I am eligible for abroad studies and hoping to get high rank in 12th exams . When I will get result then I will apply for abroad. Today my result will out and on tomorrow I will go to agent and give him all documents.

I got my result with supply. My life is no more for me . I am weeping , crying nobody here to listen me . All are blaming me but I know I did my best in exams. I have great faith in *GOD*. So I give exam again to clear my supply and I am pass . With a happy mood I apply for New Zealand but unfortunately my visa do not approved . Then I am forcing my parents to apply again. Still they are with me. Again with a great hope I apply . This time I will get study visa definitely because I know I fulfill all requirements of New Zealand embassy .

I fly in aeroplane and make new white friends, Today I come back from NZ with Medicines degree (6 years) and I get up because my phone start ringing.

SH*T!!

Its my dream. I pick  call and say WHERE DREAMS ARE TAKING ME ..??? because I get refusal again. I am totally finished from inside as my dream is spoiled.
