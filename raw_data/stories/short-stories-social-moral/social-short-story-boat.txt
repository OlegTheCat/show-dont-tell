 

He is in the boat going to unknown place. It is midnight and he is escaping from peaceful life. He is afraid of his past life of crimes and punishments. Now he is in search of safe place to hide. Everybody feels happy and unhappy for certain moments as and when they feel safe and unsafe. We always have some promises in life that we will be given heaven of fortunes. The Boat of fortune comes to take us away from troubles in life to accord peace in life.

The boat promised that there is an island where all will be very safe and happy, there will be no danger like punishments for crimes, as a matter fact, there is no system, no society or people. Everyone likes freedom, the freedom to do and the freedom to live and ultimately, the freedom to die.

You know, you are not master of everything around you and you live just thinking that everything is yours, you die with your thinking of owning everything with you, a freedom of ultimate no-questions asked  and no-restrictions imposed, given to you as the gift to you by nature, how great this will be to live there? It’s great and it must be great like heaven, right?

-Do you mean to say that there no crimes?

-Why worry about crimes? Man lives amid crimes like a a lotus amid the wet mud.

-What do you mean by that? Crimes are all around us?

-yes. Peace is not running away from crimes, coming out from comes and troubles.

-Come again. You mean to say that crimes are uncontrolled and spread around us and we should not be disturbed by crimes?

-yes, crimes are not born. Life is not born as perfectly protected in nature. Nature is truth before our eyes. Killing is instinct for certain creatures.  When hungry, kill and eat. We kill fish and chicken, many more lives to eat. Hunger is everywhere taking lives. It is not crime. To live happily, you must have freedom to live as you like. When you live free, you feel happy. I believe, a happy man can make others too live happy.

-you say something, I don’t know.

-How?

-If I am happy, how I can make others happy?

-You want a company of happy men around you. So you love like-minded people to stay around you. This means, you make a group of happy men and if some one in the group is unhappy, you do some thing and make him live happy.

-I am a criminal inside. A tiger or a cobra or man eater inside and saint outside. How can I be good for people around me?

-You are not a criminal by birth. No one, in fact, is born as criminal. People do crimes by circumstance and thus spoil harmony of other’s lives in society.

-Because, I am spoiling the peace of mind in society, I will be punished. It is the system made in society to protect harmony and safety of others living in society, the system is  of the people, by the people and for the people.

-Are you sure that the system is good to kill a man?

-When someone is cronical and requests the government to kill him to get relieved from unbearable torture of desease, he may be killed. So, here the system is good to kill a man.

-Wait I am asking about a system.

-What is the relation?

-We are speaking about the system and its relation with killing people or anti-social elements. Criminals are dangerous future for any society.

-Why not? Who has the right to kill? We all are to live safe.

-I have one doubt.

-What?

-Are you a criminal?

-yes, I told you about this before I stepped in to boat.

-What are your crimes?

-Two rapes and four murders- all in one.

-What is all in one?

-I raped my wife two times.

-Wife? How do you say this is a rape?

-It’s against her will. So did not accept, but I used force to have her..

-Why she did not accept?

-Because, I did not marry her?

-Then, how she is your wife?

-I married her, after the rapes. So she is my wife.

-Tell me about your four murders?

-I met my wife before she is my wife, so four people said that I am criminal. They stand for what they said and I ‘murdered the statements of my crime’ by marrying my wife. Thus all the four are murders, killing men or living statemts are alike by their stand, and I am a criminal. A system inside  has a court inside that gives judgement inside and a real man has to follow the judgemts given by inside court. I am expelled from my country so I am in your bout.

The boatman laughed…loudly.

-Why do you laugh?

-If internal system says that something about you is not good, you have to feel guilty of it. Then you can correct yourself. If you do not feel this, you cannot correct yourself, even if external systems punish you. So, internal harmony is more powerful than external peace. So you are right to get out of here, as it is the order of law to follow.

-Do you support me?

-Yes. A rainy day can be transformed in to a sunshine morning? Do you know how?

-Yes, If the rain stops and sun shine.

-Just like that. If the internal system demands to get the character inside you is corrected, it happens to be a miracle like sun shines removing all the dirt of darkness from your home, your heart. Then you see everything is as clean as shining like the Sun in mid day.

Sun rises.

SUNSHINE

It iseverywhere. Wow.

All of a sudden.

the boat vanished.

I opened the eyes. It is late to rise sun shines, no problem, today is sunday.
