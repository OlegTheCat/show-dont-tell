From that day I started moving around meeting different people and solving their problems. Blessed are those whose career and purpose of life are the same. Unless you bring your soul and body together into whatever you do you cannot be perfect. Today I am in a problem but i don’t know who to ask and where to go looking for some suggestions. Can anyone help once a guy who took things easy in life is now thinking how to live life?

THINK… THINK AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE CONCLUDING AND DECIDING
