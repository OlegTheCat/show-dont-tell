I used to be that girl who had her life on track, I was a witness to my fathers murder that’s when I fell back. Drugs, gangs, and alcohol was all I did to forget, it through me completely off track and the last thing I wanted was to see my mom upset.

Half my life I was caught up with the law getting arrested, I was the only person I knew that was this bad it was kinda depressing. But all the years people laughed and doubted me, instead of giving up I pushed hard and got my self together so everyone can see.

So many years feeling trapped cuz there’s was no one to relate to but finally I found someone and he tried to help me through. Everyone thought they were gunna lose me to drugs, momma crying already preparing so when I pass she can be strong. But I did what people didn’t expect and I got sober, so far it’s been 5 weeks this time it’s for sure over.

Pretty impressive for a troubled drug attic to go to college and not give up but I’m actually gunna go, stay strong motivate other kids make my mom proud cuz I need her to know. For everyone who is thinking of giving up, don’t do it just think of me and my experiences and keep a positive mindset I stuck with.

Believe me it’s not easy cuz withdrawals are kicking my ass, but it’s no excuse to not follow ur dreams and achieve the goals you want so you can pass. People say if I wrote a book it’d be the saddest thing they ever read, but it gets better when my life gets on track and I’m successful because it gives hope and show that everyone can. Right now my happiness is true and I can stop pretending, I thank everyone especially my mom for helping me to get this happy ending.
