 

Its been an month you haven’t reply my any letter. I know you are in stressed regarding our future and its killing you from inside after getting failed in last year. You know what just take a rest and bring your mind at peace.

I know your parents are forcing you to do more high grade study and lately I was also forcing you. But forcing you to do high grade study doesn’t means I need you as a investor for me, in future….. I need you as a lover, passionate person .. Who has a great respect…

I need you as savior… Who can save me from all circumstances.

I want to say that you are our world.. You are everything and you will always be. Never let those bad feeling get inside you. Never think that you are alone. Never think of ending the life. It will just make your life miserable. And I can’t see you in miserable life, not only me your parents will also not be able to face this situation. 

I know you can succeed and you will succeed. You were Always the TOPPER and you will always be. Don’t take to much stress regarding future. Always look at the positive side. We all know you can do it and only you can. 

This last year will be the best year of your University, I promise and I also promise that after completing the year I will inform my parents about us as you did. 

Please always remember your parents and I always love you.

Just don’t get aggressive and over emotional by thinking about future or studies or bad tantrums and all..

Always be the one who you was..

And Always Remember…. Some people are Always there for you…… And never gonna leave….. And always gonna Love you..

Your Life…
