She is just another naive little girl who thinks that fantasy can happen in reality. She thinks a prince will fall in love with her instantly. She thinks she will have friends that will never leave her. She thinks everything will be fine but she knows life is not a movie. She thinks a lot. She analyzes things a lot but she walks life laidback and carefree. She thinks life can be easy. She has positive outlook in life. She always faces forward. She is  a daydreamer.

But, just like any other girl, she is insecure about many things. She always laugh but does not have a lot of friends. She got ambitions. She cares from behind. She has been hurt. She is always disappointed. She’s not satisfied. She loves how the things they are but she longs for one thing – a change.

One rainy morning, she was walking by the street looking up the sky, playing with her umbrella and catching raindrops. Her eyes showed subtle loneliness. She stared at the world around her and thought, “Ah! They must be feeling better drinking coffee with friends.”

Her feet were cold from the rain and still continued to walk. She stopped by a bookstore.  She thought again, “Life could be better if it’s a book. Surreal but complete – there’s adventure, friendship and love.”

She sighed. “It must nice to feel love,” she said to herself.

Her whole body is shivering because of cold yet she continued to walk. She saw a toy catching machine and smile at the stuffed cat holding a clover leaf and smiling peacefully. She dropped a coin to get the cat. She missed. She pulled another coin and prayed over it. She smiled then dropped the coin. She missed again. She stared at the cat and said with a low voice, “I would love to have you but my luck’s not enough.” She walked away from the machine then the rays kissed her forehead. She smiled and was contented.

What did she pray for?
