Life….none of us can define life, but life is defined according to a persons behavior, routine,and attitude. Sometimes all of as wonder what is life? and some are just fade up of life without trying to know what life is. some people realize that life is very short to enjoy all the moments and try to live every minute of their life, while few just live there life because they have to live, they live only for there family, friends and loved ones and does not want to enjoy anything.

According to me life is just a game, and their are no one in your team you have to play alone. In this game sometimes due to your carelessness, your opponent may over come you and sometimes due to your smartness you may overcome your opponent.Here their is no match fixing, you have to play it honestly because god has his eyes on you.This game is usually played with the peoples hearts and feelings.

The winner is only one,The bravest, the most courageous, the strongest, and last but not the least, the most honest person.The winner is awarded with a ticket to heaven, where he will treated as a king. While the loser is sent back to his doorstep with a free entry ticket to hell, where he will be punished for not playing the game honestly and breaking the rules of this game of life.Its all up to us what way we choose.

This game of life is already written, we just play it to try our luck, trying make people successful, who knows maybe you will win a ticket to heaven and get a chance to be treated as a king .But in this game dont 

The only way to win this game of life is to play it sincerely and follow the rules honestly….ALL THE BEST…..
