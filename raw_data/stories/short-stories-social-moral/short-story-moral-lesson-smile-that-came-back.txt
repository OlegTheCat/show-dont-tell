Short Story with Moral Lesson – A Smile That Came Back

Short Story Moral Lesson – A Smile That Came Back

An experience which was unexpected surprise from a known stranger.

There’s this girl at my workplace who joined a few months back.

My impression of her was of a cute little chubby kiddo.

We have two separate offices on same floor so i had to go to the other office for drinking water.

She sat in old office.

Everytime i went there to fill my bottle we glanced at each other and i would smile at her as we normally smile to someone working in the same organization but she dint.

Once,,,,,twice,,,,,,thrice and i dont remember the count after that.

Then at one point even i thought “chodo yaar kal se mai bhi smile nai karungi kya zaroorat hai”

Then again i felt my stubborn kid in me say kab tak smile nai karegi. Mai roz smile karungi lets see how long she doesnt smile.

Then my life changed a bit, i dint go to office for few days.

Later when i resumed work i had forgotten about that girl and smile etc. I used to ask the housekeeping staff to fill the bottle for me and my visit to the other office became less.

Today again i had to go to the office and my bottle was almost empty so i went to fill it as well and was lost in my thoughts when i saw a girl smiling at me.

I was like…

What a surprise…

We even exchanged hi’s n names…

When going towards my desk all i could think was is…

The smile i gave out sometime back finally did return to me.

What ever you give out will come back in some way or other.

So spread smiles and love.
