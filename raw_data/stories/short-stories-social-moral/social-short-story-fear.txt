Social Short Story – Fear

 from 

During childhood a big black dog come out of dark, he had rage in his face, my heart skip a beat as he started to chase me. I ran like it was the last run of my life and thought my lifeline ends here itself. Escaping that horrendous creature seemed to be the only aim of life that time. I quiver whenever I see a dog now. Its teeth seems like a butcher knife which would come and murder me and that eyes is of a devil which can do no good to me. My hair stands, my spine shivers, my life comes to halt when I see that creature that terrifying thing. It is the spookiest creature in earth.

As an adult I was always anxious about my job what if I lost my job what will happen to my family would we be able to survive in this big bad world. I have seen the poor being exploited and victimised they have fear of everything the riot, the catastrophe, the rise in price what if I lose my job will the same thing happen to my family. I also dread of losing my loved ones whenever the phone rang it always give me tremor and sensation that bad news on the way that time I could feel every detail of the place it seemed like everything can fall apart within minutes and destroy us.

Now I’m an old lady, I stick to my couch so I don’t have to walk so much, what if  I slip I will break all my bones at once. Though I loved to walk around but now I  my heart trembles when I try to walk around. Now I also don’t want to get outside my home there are many of things that could stress me out and can give me a heart attack. Death is painful and I want to escape the thought of it makes me want to scream and howl all day and all night.

We all have fears and in every aspect of life we need to learn how to overcome it.
