Wonders of life begin with dreams. The dream is an individual figure that reflects your own identity that projected to the world. Deciding a goal are their personal choice and not people’s option.  There is a contrast between dreams and passion. People tend to follow their passion and left away thoughts. They might success but not relish themselves. People can have passion towards anything interest them to go with it. Maybe it off the dreams. People might have a passion for music, but zero knowledge about music can’t play a good song. 

Having a dream and deciding a passion towards it is a better choice than most wander around. Why people out there can become so outstanding while we want them to inspire us, all people are born to create something and can be ingenuity to others.

Battling in between passion and dreams, we need the knowledge to equalise both to outline our journey. Emphasising the power of knowledge are fortune key for stepping stones towards our mission. Knowledge is broad and varies that fitted with nowadays education system.  Education is a tool that highlights dreams. Be wise choosing correct segments that pursue our goals with passion.

 Bluntly, don’t let our dreams obsoleted by others and our laziness.

Bear in mind, that right knowledge is open doors to dreams, and great passion enhanced a creative and beautify life that all we are wander around.

Scared to fail without trying can’t be the one you dreamt off to be in the future. Get failed and bravely failed where you’ve left we’re are in the process of engaging and enhancing our dreams. So dare to try facing failure for future enlightenment of dreams with huge success.

Having a dream by making it right and let it become true not only by wishes but via action full of passion.
