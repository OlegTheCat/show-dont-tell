These are the kind of little things that are necessary in a child’s life to make him a well mannered and a polite kid. The Tremendous support can be provided by anyone.

Some 8 year old has just gone through a bullying by his classmate and all his friends are laughing at that 8 year old.

He picks up his bag and just tries to escape from this situation but only if that bully would allow him to do so. Again with his loud but hurtful voice he screams “Leave me alone, Let Me go”. As He wriggle’s away, he remembers his Mother’s words to ‘be brave and stay calm’ he stopped crying.

The First thing he does when he reaches home is just cry in his bed till his mother comes to know his pain. Without a delay she places him under her calm hands and soothe him till he falls asleep. All Night he had nightmares regarding his terrifying session of bullying.

The next morning as he woke up, he noticed it’s past his usual waking up time. His mother enters the room and says “Don’t worry. you don’t have to go school today”, this gave a huge sigh of relief to the kid. He then finishes his breakfast in a relatively happier mood. Afternoon his mother again came to his bedroom while he was at his computer watching some Animation, she asked him about the other day and all of a sudden he was feeling depressed. He told her everything.

The next morning his mother went to his school and talked with his teacher. Then the teacher called out that bully and taught him how to behave with others and show some manners to the people around you. That bully then apologized to that kid and they shook their hands.

These are the moments when support of someone can make or break the case. In his case his mother’s support was crucial otherwise his childhood would had become more painful for him and he would become a different person all together.
