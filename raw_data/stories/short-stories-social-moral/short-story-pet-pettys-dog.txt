 from 

There was girl named Petty who lived with her parents in a small town and of course a small house, but enough for them to make out their whole life.

One windy day, Petty found a puppy roaming around the streets with a dog tag on it. When she found the dog, the dog seemed very well maintained and Petty knew that the dog was lost and the dog tag had the name Jammy, a she dog. She threw away the dog tag and took the dog home. Petty took the dog inside her house and begged her parents to keep the dog, so they decided to let her keep the dog until the dog did not find its real owners.

It was almost a year, and the family decided to keep the dog. Years spent together at every season with a new family, the dog. They were having a lot of fun and Jammy was almost 2 and a half since she came. Petty then remembered and mumbled to herself, “the owners of dog must be in tears because a dog is like a family to us, how come we kept her all these years?”.

So, Petty goes to her parents and asks if the dog’s owner can be found again, and her parents agreed. They pasted posters all over their area with a mobile number and an address on it. Still, the dog’s owners were not found yet. But, one fine morning a woman visited their house and asked if they have their dog because she saw the poster and they were like, “of course, we have her”. The woman broke down in tears, she was very happy to find her dog. The woman thanked the family a lot for finding her lost dog because the dog was like a family to her. Families can never be forgotten.
