 

It was a fine morning ,i woke up early thinking that i would stay healthy and CALM!!

As I try to remain that big CALM and quiet ,most of the people take it as advantage ,

So that morning I decided to change myself,in the fine clear rays of sun ,I decided to be like him HOT and HARSH

We met many people in our life and most of the time they either gave us memory to perrish or a lesson to live.

That morning I was very tensed as my whole life was in front of my eyes .

What most tensed me that I failed to make a single good friend in my life?

I repeatedly asked myself am I so unlucky that I could not make a single good friend who would support me like circuit support Munna Bhai .

Most of my colleagues and classmates had many good friends and they were happy with each other.

I was so lonely and depressed most of times, like a lonely flower without the garden. I was never watered left alone in this Earth to live on itz own.

So in morning after doing some exercise ,I asked a question to myself,a very important que??

If I am alone then who helped me to grow this much,who helped me to face that autumn season,who helped me be myself right now?

Clearly the ans was !Yes I Exist For A Purpose !Yes there was someone who is always there to hold my hand ,who is always there to water me

God was there for me to hold my hand ,like a mother holds a child hand .

I made a One Last Call to God, for everything that he has bestowed upon everyone in this universe

Yes now I can truly say I have a got a true friend who is the giver, without expecting anything in return…My Call
