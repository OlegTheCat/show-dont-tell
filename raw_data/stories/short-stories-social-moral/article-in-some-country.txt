The people should determine Country. Yes, of course, every person has different behavior. But when all enter to society they all give some priority to social norms but that norms were not same to all people and group people have same norms and they live in one place that place called country.

So every county has different norms because it has different people.

Some country gives priority to people freedom, some country gives priority to something else. So every country has own rules to guide their people.

Whatever it makes different to every country. So its make different look to each other.Some kind people live difficult to their country and some kind people live luxury life same country. They look are different from each other. Why this difference? Because of various reason.

The world is “place of good living”. But nowadays its will change to every country, change living rate for people. In Some country Should have all facilities to their people like good water, air, food, etc..

In some country people to difficult to Survival because of their Race, Religion, caste, etc.,

Every people think to live a good life for a long day without ill. But in some country people very difficult to get their basic medical even that country will make more illness to them for some reason.

Human identity is love but some country forget their identity even its make trouble to other countries. Maybe they should know well, what are they doing? And some country support to other country growth also but it’s had some profit.

We are live one world but we are dividing some Geographical, Culture, Belief, etc., When you travel to the world every country give a different opinion to you. But Some country only near to your heart that depends upon our Perspective.
