Ravi and Rajiv were two brothers in a family. Ravi was elder than Rajiv. Rajiv was doing job after his graduation whereas Ravi was not interested in studies and used to do electricity work at home because he got the training of Electrician and Plumber but nobody cares about it because he works free of cost at his own house.

Ravi’s parents always degraded him before relatives because his brother was earning for his livelihood and they didn’t want to send him for work of Plumber and Electrician due to their social image which hurts him.

One day, Ravi felt very much insulted before his relatives. He got irritated and said to his parents ” You can’t respect my talent. I work free-of -cost at home. So, you can’t give me respect . If there will be any electricity problem , then please call any Electrician at home for work”

Ravi’s father scolded him and said ” Yes, we will call an electrician next time for Electricity problem. You are idle at home.”

One day, Invertor stopped working at home but Ravi didn’t want to repair it and advised to call an Electrician. When Electrician came at home, he asked for Rs 2000 for servicing and repair which was very huge amount because Ravi never charged such type of amount due to his free service at his own house. His parents began to bargain but the Electrician told ” This is my fixed rate and I am giving you the guarantee of one month. You can understand the value of my service, otherwise, you can call any other electrician for work who can charge same amount”.

It was the first time when parents understood the value of Ravi’s work because his work was free of cost. They paid the cost to Electrician and realized their mistake. Then , they felt sorry to Ravi and decided to open the shop of Plumber and Electrician for Ravi which was the good step for Ravi’s livelihood.
