A Beggar lived in a town with his eighteen years old dumb daughter. He begged daily sitting in the courtyard of a temple situated in the townâ€™s market. He was a handicapped. He uses to reach the temple early morning so that no other beggar could take his place. In the same town, a trader who was the owner of a jewelry shop also came daily to the temple to pray before opening his shop. The trader met daily with the beggar in a normal way. He paid the beggar a rupee per day.
