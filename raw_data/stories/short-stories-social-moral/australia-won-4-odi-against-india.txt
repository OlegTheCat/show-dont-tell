 Venue: Bengaluru

 Date: Sept. 28, 2017

 Occasion: 4th ODI

 Toss won by Captain Steve Smith and chose to bat

 Match started: 1.30 PM instead of 2.30 PM due to cloudy weather.

 Heroes of The Match

 1. David Warner – 124 runs – “Man of The Match”.

 2. Aaron finch – 94 runs.

 3. Richardson – Took 3 wickets including Dhoni’s.

 Winning the toss Australian Captain decided to bat.

 David Warner and Aaron finch started batting as opening batsmen.

 David Warner scored 124 runs in 119 balls with the help of 12 fours and 4 sixes.

 Aaron Finch made 94 runs in 96 balls with 10 fours and 3 sixes.

 Both the batsmen were seen very aggressive in collecting runs fast and thus, their partnership added 231 runs to the total runs scored by whole team as 334 runs in 50 overs and it is no exaggeration to admit that it helped a lot to defeat India Team.

 Handskomb also added 43 runs which proved to be fruitful in winning the match.

 India Team could be able to score only 313 runs in 8 wickets and thus lost the match by 21 runs ultimately.

 Though Rahane, Rohit Sharma and Jadhav scored 53, 65 and 67 runs respectively but others could not perform as expected from them, Virat Kohli bowled by Nile when he was at 21 in 21 balls with 3 fours. It was the unfortunate part of the match for India and the second one Rohit Sharma was run out when he was in full form and batting vigorously all the way. There was hope against hope when Dhoni came for batting but unfortunately, Richardson bowled him out at 13 runs with one four and one six. After that Axar Patel, Md. Shami and Umesh Yadav could made 5,6 and 2 runs only respectively.

 The saddest part of chasing is that India Team nearing to the target of 334 runs to win the match lost it in the long run.

 From the start of July 17 to September end till 27th India could win 9 matches consecutively but here in this ODI India could not touch the figure of 10. Before it from Nov. 2008 to Feb. 2009 Captain MS Dhoni had already recorded 9 matches win one after another consecutively and unfortunately Captain Virat Kohli failed to surpass his (Dhoni’s) previous record.

 It could be a repent for Captain Virat Kohli for today’s defeat by Australia by 21 runs.

 Taking 4 wickets by Umesh Yadav went in vain when India lost the match. No regret as it happens so in cricket matches.

 The stadium was houseful and the Indian spectators enjoyed every four and six made so furiously by both the opening batsmen namely Aaron Finch and David Warner. Every one admired their bold batting all the way, all around the field too.

 I too watched their tactful batting and congratulated them for win against India Team after the consecutive 3 defeats. This win worked as an enthusiastic catalyst and do hope and believe in the 5th. ODI to be played in Nagpur on 1st October 2017 they will perform better to repeat the today’s win there too.

 Congrats to Australian Team for this superb win!
