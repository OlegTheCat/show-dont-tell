 This win was just like the bolt from the blue as India Team was in a great trouble, chances for winning this match were very little inasmuch as India were 131 runs for 7 wickets and it appeared too difficult to chase 231 runs in 47 overs of Sri Lanka team in accordance with Duc birth Luis rule.

 Though Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan added 103 runs jointly – Rohit Sharma – 54 runs and Shikhar Dhawan – 49 runs but unfortunately both went to pavilion while Rohit Sharma was run out and Shikhar Dhawan was bowled by Srivardhana and caught by Mathews.

 It is necessary to know as to how and when 6 wickets gone:
