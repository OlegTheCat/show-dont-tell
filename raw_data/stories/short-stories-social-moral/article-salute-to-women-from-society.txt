The one main reason I’m indebted to god is for the creation of two beautiful women in my life: Mother and sister

 In a country like India may be one women’s day is not enough for all the sacrifices they does for the sake of family. If there is any justification for unconditional love.. That would only be coming from mother.

 All the women who are working out, running for career and job would still does all the house hold chores without pain.

Every day is not the same for you. Daily going to college or office is not the same task as you have to pass through thousands of eyes poking you all over, but you will never complain. For the society you are happily married but only you have seen the most brutal violence which you couldn’t share with anyone.

 But above all you maintained calm and still does your duties without hesitation.

 And we Men salute you for being in our lives.

 Many say things changes.. We have to move on!

But no, things remains constant..

My old sofa where i used to fall asleep unwillingly in the nights during my childhood is still the same…but now i don’t do that.

My remote car which used to bring utmost joy on my face is still in our showcase, but now i don’t even look at it.

That chocolate which i used to go crazy is still the same, but now i don’t pay any interest to buy!

Things doesn’t change.. It’s we humans, who changes!!

My friend who worked so hard and studied day and night only to clear civils exam. He has an immense knowledge about law and constitution, never indulged in illegal activity. Before joining the duty, he was closely scrutinised whether are there any criminal charges against him and got a positive certificate from police verification. And now he joined duty, where he has to report a minister who has 3 cases against him including a murder attempt.

 I feel something is very wrongly shaped in our society!!!
