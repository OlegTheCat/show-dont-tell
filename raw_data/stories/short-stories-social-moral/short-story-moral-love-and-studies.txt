Do you believe in 

 at 

? Many believe, 

, for me there are some steps to fall in love. You are walking on the street and a beautiful girl passes. You get attracted towards her. When you come to know she is in your class you start having crush on her. In couple of days you make her your friend and keep interest in her. Slowly get known about her good habits you start liking her.

Days passes and both of you becomes close friends and her bad qualities comes in front, fights starts, understand and everything else. You don’t leave your girl at that time rather you try to change here bad qualities into good one and same time you also get converted. After moving with all this hurdle at the end you fall in love with her.

Same thing is about studies. You get clear and it’s the start of new academic year. You listen name of subject and get attracted towards it. When you get known that subject is in your syllabus you start having crush on it. Soon you become friendly with subject, in the beginning start with the easy chapter and start liking the subject. I compare that easy chapter with the good qualities of your girl.

As the time passes you start with the difficult part and you say “I can’t do it”, “It has cracked my head”, “it’s so difficult” and you are ready to leave it. I ask you why? I compare that difficult part with the bad qualities of your girl, if you are not ready to leave her then why you want to the subject, rather I suggest you should convert that difficult into easy by devoting your time, application of your brain, creating more interest in it. If you are able to do that you start falling in love with that subject.

I know if you love subject then you can never fail in it.
