  There? It’s me, Jack!

Yes, the same. I am indeed the legendary Jack in the box. I know, we haven’t been in touch for some time, now that you  have become a fully fledged individual and can’t spare time to smile with me. But in the name of our childhood bond, I can ask you for a little help, right? I am stuck in a no-win situation. Go on, mock me! But I am serious! Please ignore my happy go lucky face. I have been drifting in the pool of trouble for some time now.You know how I always had to stick out amongst  all your toys, and how I celebrated the monopoly of my uniqueness amongst them. Well, today my monopoly stands challenged.

She imitates all of my traits. Like me, she stays inside her bolted box. Like me, she stays out in the light of day but can’t really step out of her box. Like me, they have devoted her to amuse people. She has a pretty smile, I am envious. But unlike me, she isn’t permitted to laugh out too loud, it’s impolite they tell her. Inquisitive, sometimes I peep through the hole of her box, I see her weep, and yet when they open the lid she manages a smile. She amuses everyone. I only amuse a child.

One day, she was dressed all in red,when i saw her.I was awestruck . But behind all the glitters , i could read her glossy eyes.On asking, she told me how she had a new set of people to amuse and  that a new box awaited her. I haven’t seen her since.

Today, she rests in the third and the final box, no one bothers with the lid now, and there are no holes from which I could peep. When I knock she doesn’t answer me, I guess her time to amuse has come to an end. But there are thousand others like her. I am afraid soon they will replace me. As a friend, I request you to help her out of the box, so that my monopoly stands unchallenged. Let the world know, that there was and will always be only one “The Great Jack-in-the-box.”
