The boss is calculating the revenues and expenses of this month. Then he signed a long breath. His wife saw that, and asked him

“Is there any problem? I saw your face full of worries. Is it the business unsatisfactory? ”

“You know, our fast food shop operates from 7 am to midnight. We have been so hardworking, and never had day-offs, but why is the balance so unsatisfying, and even in deficit at times?”

After hearing the complaint of her husband, the boss’s wife thought for a while, and then replied

“My dear, have you ever thought of the reason for this? You are industrious, working from morning till night. However, have you thought of the location of our shop being at an unnoticeable alley? Our customers are mainly taxi drivers, students, and people who live nearby. And they mainly frequent our shop at day time. During evenings there are few customers. Perhaps let’s forgo the evening business operation and we’ll operate till around 6 pm. In that way we not only can pay attention to our customers, and at the same time, we could have more time cleaning up after we close. Our shop is not big, and we depend on our regular customers. We don’t need to reduce our prices of food. Only if the price and the quality of food are acceptable, plus our services are good, I believe we could change our predicament.”

The husband heard about that, thinking “It’s worth a try! After all it has been so poor in business now.”

And so ten years have passed, the business of the boss has been stabilized. Their shop is the only one that doesn’t serve evening meals in the neighborhood. They own a crowd of loyal customers. Also, they could enjoy family life, and need not to be the slaves of their shop any more.
