Life is the most precious thing given to us by almighty. We must not take this for granted. It is our duty to make this more enjoyable, helpful for others and memorable for the society. We expect a lot from the life without doing anything. This can not be possible by any chance. One must remember Newton’s law of inertia. Unless we apply some external force the status will remain the same. Similarly in our life unless we put effort (force) towards getting the desired result, nothing can move in the life.

We need to be focused and determined towards what we are dreaming for. Once the focus and determination in place we need to work towards that with honesty. Result will come and it will come the way you wanted to be. We can not keep on wishing by the side of river that a fish can come in your bag rather we need to get into the water with a rod to catch a fish.  We are given one life only and we can not take any chance just like that. We are the designer of our own lives. Lets decorate it with jewels like love, peace, joy, brotherhood and happiness.

One who does that becomes the richest person on this planet earth. The best is the more you share such jewels the more you become richer. Such jewels are infectious. Spread them to the fullest. It is very easy to buy materialistic jewelries from the shop and get your external part decorated, But the real beauty lies in your inner part and that can be further beautified by possessing non materialistic jewels. Stop taking life as a gamble and make it more meaningful by having and spreading Love, Peace, Brotherhood and Happiness.

JAI HO!!!
