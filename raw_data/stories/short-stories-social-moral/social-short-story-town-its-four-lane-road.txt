The road of the small town was to be concretised and four laned.

The surveyor with yellow cap and his assistant with a long pole came first.The surveyor mounted his camera like apparatus on a tripod stand. His assistant moved to near and distant places and marked those places on the old road with yellow paint.

Then came the turn of the trees to be cut.Centuries old gigantic trees were cut branch by branch then main tree. Finally powerful digger was used to uproot the underground portion.

The electric poles and substations were to be shifted.Power cut was announced on every day for indefinite period.

A huge digging tractor came and started digging one side of the road.It dug around waist deep and the earth and rubble of the old road were loaded to dumpers.The digging and loading continued through the night. Traffic was diverted to the other road.

Then came dumpers loaded with sand which filled the bottom portion. Big leveling tractor leveled the sand. This layer was topped with red stone material and levelled again. Water was sprayed on the surface and levelled again.The road was left as such for a week.Then small patches were perfectly balanced and sheet of polythene was laid. Thick iron rods were made a frame with iron cages on all sides.Concrete mixture from their workshop was brought in big rotating drummed trucks and was poured in the frames. With the help of a vibrator, the concrete was evenly spread.The road was covered with jute bags for a week and watered regularly to season.

Finally white & yellow boarders and lines were drawn and the road was thrown open to public.

Now the town is having nice concrete road. The trees are gone. It has become hotter. In summer there is no tree shade to rest. People are talking about the huge trees that provided so much of comfort in summer.
