Sandhya got up late on Friday. She had a terrific last evening with her classmates. She was getting married in a week’s time! She sat casually on the balcony, staring at passersby.

Suddenly, she saw a group of poor small kids passed from her home lane. They were 6 in number, all were in the age group of 6 to 10 years.

They were cute but their condition was pathetic. They did not have proper clothes but they were still too happy and were playing and crawling.  She was touched by the glare in their life, so calm without the basic things. She forgot, who she was, and from which family did she belong. Without wasting an inch of a minute, she decided to help them with clothes, books, and food.  She packed a big Air Bag with this stuff, and went downstairs to share her happiness with them. But to her astonishment, they had gone far away, were not in reach. She felt bad for getting late on reaching the kids. She came back, sat in the room, start watching TV to overcome her anxiety.

It was 6’O clock in the evening; suddenly she heard some long noise coming from outside her main door. To her surprise, it was the same kids, and they were playing football in the park near her house.

She immediately went downstairs, caught hold of those kids, and gave them the stuff which she had packed in the bag. The kids were delighted to see the magnanimity of this young lady.

Their smiles and happy faces left her with a promise to help the deserving kids and poor people.

Inference: Goodness doesn’t have leaps and bounds. The inner desire to help the needy irrespective of limited resources is key to taking blessings from the person/people and a sprinkle of love, happiness, and prosperity!
