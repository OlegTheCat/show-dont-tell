 None could have thought of how India could take all 10 wickets merely in one day, but as the cricket is termed as the game of uncertainty it happened in the MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai.

 1. Virat Kohli remarks it is not the team but a family that played together and won the match by an innings and 75 runs.

 2. Sandip Patil ex-captain says it is a great win by Team India beyond one’s imagination.

 3. Someone says it is a grand exploding win by Indian Team.

 4. Another says, “We have seen so many champions but not the emperor of cricket.

 5. “It’s an absolutely stunning performance from Team India.” – Aditya Deshpande added.

 As there prevails comedy and tragedy in one’s life, I am of the opinion even in game & sport same is the case somewhere else. In this fifth day test match everyone enjoyed the match with tremendous victory against England but a few people including myself are disappointed that Lokesh Rahul couldn’t make double century, his bad luck he was out at 199 runs, and the second tragedy that Karun Nair couldn’t surpass the highest runs of 319 scored earlier by Virendra Sahvag, he lagged behind him by 17 runs only.

 The captain could have declared a little bit earlier but waited till he made triple century, not beyond that on Team’s interest.

 Virat Kohli led the team very effectively and wisely too that he came out the champion of the champions by defeating England by an innings and 75 runs. Such a win is reckoned as grand slam in the cricket test play records and the people who have seen this superb performance by Team India will remember it for a pretty long time.

Hearty Congratulation to Virat Kohli and his Team (family) for this grand win!
