 from 

Today , when I was coming home from my college. I noticed these three kids scrounging in the garbage . I asked one of them”,what’s your name ?”.

He immediately replied me “Amit”.

I asked him , “what are you looking in this garbage?”.

He answered me ” gold”.

According to them , gold can be anything like a single penny,single shoe , plastic , metal scraps etc. After this I questioned them “Do you go to school? “.

All of them noded their head. Amit told me his parents and their too don’t allow them to go to school. I was quite angry and dissapointed with that but I can’t do anything.

One of Amit’s friend shouted ” Gold found”.

I was also curious along wit them but they found some used plastics bottles and opposite to me they were happy with that . I curiously asked them”What you will do with these plastic bottles?”.

After taking a deep thought about it, Amit replied ” We wil give these to our parents and after it they sell it”.

After it they moved on to other place and I accompanied them. As we were crossing the park, Amit stopped and looked at a child enjoying himself on sea -saw. I asked him ” do you want to go to the park?” .

He answered hesitatingly ” I want to but caretaker of the park don’t allow them to stay and play there”.

Then, I took all of them to the park and asked them to enjoy themselves out there. For few minutes they were quite afraid but after it they started running towards the sea-saw. Witnessing their enjoyment provided me great pleasure. After one and a half hour , we left the park. I was getting late so I decided to leave them.

While I was leaving to home Amit said” thank you”. I couldn’t forget the smile on his face and really that made my day.
