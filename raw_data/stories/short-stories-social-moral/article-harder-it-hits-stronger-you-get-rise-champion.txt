Keep patience, build stamina stronger to work on your weaknesses and until you get the excellence in your work which you dreamed about and working every day.

Things will get difficult, people will be harsh but the only thing you have to keep in your mind is that you started your journey with no one it was your vision to go one and do something, then don’t hesitate whatever the circumstances become.

You have to sure that you will never lose sight to see things in a very clearly positive manner. Look at the brighter at the initial stage it will make your heart and mind stronger and proactive.

You have to swallow every painful circumstance to outperform everyone out there.

Sometimes giving up is not the option for you, the more you sweat today;

the more you smile tomorrow but maintain the consistency to be in the race.

If someone asks you why you take that pain then simply say these lines of Robert Frost as “Miles to go before I sleep” from his poem “The road not taken”

People will work with you, they will join your league but you have to keep heading towards your way destiny.

It’s not necessary to daily have a chat with your best friends and loved ones, instead, you must have healthy and genuine conversations with them; make sure that you listen to them more and more.

Departures are for sure, tears will roll down, Goodbye will leave heavy throat and it becomes difficult to speak.

All those pains and griefs will be worthy one day when you look back, something which remains with you is that your will-power and grace of God above is something you need.

But there’s another day coming.Be ready for what next is coming because at the end it’s your journey.
