 from 

Once Swapnil was in search of a rented room. After a long day’s search, he got one. But the astonishing thing for him was the owner would be staying in ground floor and he was given the first floor for rent. But without a second thought he started staying. It was all going fine until rainy season. Water started dropping in Swapnil’s room from terrace at different places. So then Swapnil understood why he was told to stay on top.

So one day Swapnil complained the same to the owner. To that the owner sarcastically replied, “Oh! no these are all signs that you have 24 hrs of water supply in this room.”

Swapnil that night before going for sleep, just opened the tap of his restroom in such a way that the water started falling drop by drop and placed a bucket under that. The whole night falling drops of water made shrieking sound. Swapnil anyway managed well to sleep.

The next morning immediately as dawn broke, the owner came running and knocked at Swapnil’s door. In fact Swapnil waking up by that knock, rubbing his eyes opened the door. The owner in his angry voice started telling, “It doesn’t mean that you would waste water since there is 24 hours of water supply.”

Swapnil to that quickly replied, “Sir I have not wasted a single drop of water. I had hurry in the morning so thought of filling the bucket at night itself. But the pace of water falling was so slow that no water has overflown from the bucket. You could well come inside and check it out.”

To that the owner told the truth, “No its not the wastage of water..Its the sound. You know it disturbed me so much that I could not sleep the whole night.”

To that Swapnil said, “Sir, you could not tolerate only the audio and that too for one night, and I am experiencing here the video, audio and wet for last 5 nights…What about that?”

To this the owner understood and immediately thought of repairing the roof.
