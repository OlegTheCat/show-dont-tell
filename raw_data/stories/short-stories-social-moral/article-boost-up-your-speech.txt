I am 27 years now. I get stuck in very few words. In my childhood I was called a stammerer by my friends. I did not know how come they called me a stammerer. I could not read the news properly in the school assembly. I felt embarrassed most of the times. My parents took me to many doctors but that didn’t worth me.

A day came when my father took me to a speech therapist. He examined me carefully and taught me many tongue exercises. I would practised those lessons 24×7, but it did not work for me when I had to talk with the strangers. Then I came to know what was the exact reason of getting stucked. It was the fear and lack of self-confidence.

These were the only two factors that clogged me to speak. I realised that my words got less stucked whenever I would talk to my parents and friends, but it happened more when I talked with the strangers. Then my journey began. I worked more and more on these two factors. I landed myself on that area of unknown people. I took it as a challenge. I faced my people whom I wanted to talk.

Initially for a couple of months I got nerves. After that, gradually I excelled in that area. My confidence boosted up. I faced many job interviews and I would love to face them.

Now I am 27 years. I work as a back office executive in a private company. I can throw my words with ease. Very few words I get stucked in. So my friends, try to make an experiment on yourselves. Try to recognise your mind. Dont give up. Not only in the field of stammering but in every field you can achieve the success. We know that sky is the limit. Your can achieve anything if you really want to.

Thank you.
