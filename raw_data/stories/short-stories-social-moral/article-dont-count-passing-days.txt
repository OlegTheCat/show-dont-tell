I have seen your worries and pains you have hiden away. You have failed at life but you still don’t grasp at what has to be offered. You haven’t looked at ways to forgive but you hold onto it like a brick. You know longer seem to enjoy the moments of happiness :darkness you see but the sun is only a mile away. Don’t count the passing days for you have not washed you mind  or got up to start your works.

It has come but still you are lost in the mist of struggles.life will still pass you and opt to stay in the middle of nowhere. You reflections cannot hid for it know your truth and lies. You have not looked at chance or change for there both are wonderful together. You will only realized that reality strikes at everything when you wake up from the dream. The past only makes the future better so pick up your pieces and go on. The days become short but you must always look beyond the rainbow.

Don’t count the passing days  because you have forgotten what real matters. Life has no tale or toll and anything can strike you without notice. You got to keep going for the opportunity of life. Don’t let the hour pass you for you will miss out on the passing day of reaping success.

It have no promises for tomorrow but only hope is what keeps you going. It slow dies for it wants you to make a difference . where did you drift passing day? Look up for I am ticking away by the minutes now and not the hour. Did you hear me? The passing day has memories of you but you were too busy.
