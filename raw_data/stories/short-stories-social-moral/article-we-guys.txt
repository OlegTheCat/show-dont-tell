Article – We Guys

We guys, are strange people (though its quite derogatory for me to say that). But we actually are. We are worthless, hopeless, crappy and crummy. We may not be the best sons or brothers. But ofcourse we are peerless friends. People, relatives, parents, cousins expect so much from us, but deep within, even they know that the guy is feckless. Mothers, sisters and all the elderlies  always complain that we never lay our hands for aid in household stuffs, day to day system of activities. We never bothered about such things. Did we??

It seems that our parents are never happy with us, never satisfied with whatever we do. And why should they. After all, What great did we do?? Is our existence the only thing they need to be elated for?  We are the underachieving children of our hugely overachieving parents, obviously they expect us to become their clones.

But there comes a moment in each and every guys life, a moment which we expect to be a restitution. A moment of eternal glory. Moments when you are so overjoyed, you well up. For all those times of being the “

” members of the civil society, we finally triumph, against all odds.

“Dad, I win!”

We are sincere, we are responsible. We learn things our way. We 

 know what is good for us. Sometimes we deviate, sometimes we drift. Sometimes we fall, but only to rise, and rise strong. We just need some faith from your side. Some motivation; little inspiration. Yeah we care, but are too stiff to show. We love, but are too un-emotional to express. We are sensitive, but too ingenious to manifest.

Evidently, we are children enslaved in a body of a grown-up. Yeah we are driven to be strange.
