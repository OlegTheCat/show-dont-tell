Some were clumsy on their feet, while others looked withdrawn. Some were sleepy even while standing and others were crying.

But Kajal was smiling. She has a smile on her face at all times. It is like she always sticks this smile on her face. I never saw her upset or disturbed. Okay, she might have felt like that way many times, she is a teenage girl and not God to not to feel these. But she always managed to show that smile. It is a sort of crooked but in a way pretty smile.

Like I saw her smiling, so does our teacher.

“You can share your joke with the class, Kajal. What is so funny about you not studying and standing on a bench? “

“Nothing teacher” Kajal replied.

She continued her smiling.

Teacher got more upset and demanded to know the reason for her smiling. I guess Kajal was not able to convince teacher that her face is smiling face. She was thrown out of the class. But the smile was still on her face.

After so many years I happened to find her in one of the social networking sites. She didn’t change a bit. That smile I remember is still glued to her face. I think that smile is a force to challenge what life throws at her. No matter what it somehow gives her inner strength.

She was called crazy during those days. Probably now, people have different attitude towards her. They go about thinking, what is she hiding? What makes her so happy?

In today’s stressful life, who would not be want to be like her?
