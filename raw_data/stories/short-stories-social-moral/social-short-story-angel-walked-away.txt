She was the craziest,happiest and the most talkative person you could find, living life to the fullest enjoying every moment of life.

Then she got married. Her husband worked in a foreign land. After few months of marriage, they were together in a distant land on their own. The first few days were spent travelling and enjoying each other’s company. Then slowly, the feeling of loneliness began creeping in. It was too much for her, with so little to do, nobody to talk to. Everything was said between’I don’t know’ and ‘Nothing’.

Then an angel came into their lives. The creeping feeling of loneliness gave way to an euphoria of happiness. The Angel helped them discover each other once again. Their small world started revolving around the Angel and his needs ,finally laughter making its way once again into their lives.

Time flew and the Angel walked away to be with another Angel to build a world of his own leaving a world revolving around him shattered with two lone souls to fend for themselves. No amount of love could make him stay.

They made a world of their own far away. Then the two angels welcomed a new Angel in their lives.

That was the day she found a blue-eyed Angel on the streets who stole her heart away..She took him home and from that day on, she found the craziest, funniest and the most talkative girl she had long lost and forgotten.

That was the day,their days no longer started and ended with ‘I don’t know’ and’Nothing’.

The Angel who walked away left them with more peace and fulfilment than they had ever been with.

That was the day they understood that happiness does not depend on a person instead it is a state of mind.

From that day forward, many angels found their way to their home to partake of the love and care they had to offer and they never denied anyone.
