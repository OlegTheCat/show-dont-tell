She was walking towards her home without any humor in her eyes, without any smile on her face but with two bags of vegetables.

It was her monotonous routine, to go to the market and pick vegetables, fruits and household amenities. At first she enjoyed this. It gave her opportunity to do something new, to explore this side of the world. Now it is her duty.

A sad smile came on her face.

She calculated the money spent and started to ponder about the dinner. What should she make?

She likes lady finger but others don’t. Should she prepare two different dishes?

A small sigh came out of her. She was tired so it would be better to make what others want.

She was staring at others with lingering feeling.

A packet of onions slipped from her hand. While gripping that, her dupatta fell on the ground.

Someone snickered at her. Suppressing a curse, she went ahead.

 

A college going guy stared at his brother, “you should not laugh at anyone.”

The younger sibling was laughing at her and turned his head towards his elder brother.

“but did you look the way she was grabbing onions? It was hilarious.”

“you should have helped her instead of doing that. Is this the way you should act?”

With shock on his face he looked at his brother, “you must be joking, she is a daughter of our gardener.”

 

Meanwhile, a ten-year-old girl sat on the porch and started cutting the vegetables.
