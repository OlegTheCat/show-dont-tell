It has been 2 days now I have not gone home. Home – is it really? I have lost you, I have lost my home. I don’t want to go back. But where am I heading? Stepping out of train, the warm sun rays were penetrating into me.

 I was hungry, more than that I was missing her, I was missing her hand cooked food.

I walked a little ahead and I stood there wondering what’s next? For how long will I be running away from truth? Tears were rolling down. Suddenly I felt a grip on my shoulder. I looked back, a man in his 50’s was looking at me gleefully.

‘Are you hungry?’ he asked. I nodded.

‘Come join us, this is my wife.’

His wife had this euphoric persona that convinced me to have food with them. After a gap of 2 days I was actually having some good home cooked food.

‘Are you here for some purpose?’ she asked. I nodded again. There was silence for 5 minutes. ‘We lost our only son before 9 years in a train accident, since then we often visit this place with food and try to find our own happiness. We try to relive in his memories by doing so’ she sighed.

And I found my purpose-

Tears again rolled from my eyes but this time I was clear what I am supposed to do. Running from situation is not an option. Yes, you are no longer a part of my life, I will never again get a chance to say ‘Maa, I am home’ but I do have a chance to cherish and do something which will keep you alive in us.

With this note I stood, smiled at that couple and understood my journey.
