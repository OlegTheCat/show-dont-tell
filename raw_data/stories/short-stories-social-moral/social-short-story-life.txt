Social Short Story – Life

People ask me what happened that day, nothing really, nothing that would shock you but was it different, maybe a bit shocking for me. We (my family) travel a lot; everybody does these days, I think. It happened in Sri Lanka. It was very simple; you know it could happen to you. Sri Lanka has beautiful sea’s, they are blue like the sky and raw of course.

I was swimming for hours now, it was almost evening I had been swimming from afternoon, the tide had risen, I was tired. I couldn’t get out of the water, I am a good swimmer, I didn’t get any medals when I swam officially, I was really slow. But I am a good swimmer anyway, but that day I was very exhausted. My mom and dad were sitting in a hotel; they had sent someone to call me back to room. I knew I was in trouble; I wasn’t able to get out simply!! But I was too rude to ask for help. He stood there calling me out. I tried to get out for some time, for minutes I think and then I gave up. I simply gave up. I closed my eyes and let myself go. When I closed my eyes I thought about the loved ones, thought about beautiful Sri Lanka that I still hadn’t discovered , thought about my friends and then I thought about me, I, you can tell am the happiest person on earth, why on earth would I do that, me? Tulip Roy, that’s not me. So, I opened my eyes and waved. I fought the waves and I was out by my own thanks to one huge wave that pushed me out. I was there standing on the shore. I learned about me that day, I learned how precious my life was and I was so lucky to be there. The magnificent universe told me how big part I was of it.

After that, when I was in the hotel, I said “I didn’t ask for help, maybe the man thought of it as a wrong signal”, after a few days I read that, the sea had some kind of well in it, that stuck people in, many swimmers had died there.
