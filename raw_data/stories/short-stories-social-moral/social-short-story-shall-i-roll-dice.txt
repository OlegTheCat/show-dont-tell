Short Story Social – Shall I roll The Dice ?

 from 

Once there was a boy. Alone. Awake late into the night, he was disturbed by his thoughts.

In his sweaty hand was a dice. The dice was anything but ordinary. It was given to him by God himself. He was surprised that God had listened to his demands & had arrived to meet him in person.

He remembered the night he had called upon God, blaming on Him all the problems of his life.

***

God gave him a simple but contemplative  solution. Handing the boy  a dice, God said, “Roll the dice. If the dice lands on the no. 1, the world would end. And with it all your problems will also end. It is my greatest creation, but I give to  you the power to destroy it. If you feel that there is no use living, then end the world.”

With that He disappeared.

As the boy took a closer look at the dice, he was further mystified. The dice had a single dot on all sides.

From the past few days, the boy had been pondering a single question – ‘Shall I roll the dice?’

He was obsessed.

He had to do something about the dice.  But he did not want to end the world. He just wanted to get rid of his problems.

***

Every time he had consoled himself by appreciating the materialistic world around him. This time was no different.

As he was once more pocketing the dice, all the problems of his life flashed before his eyes.

The enormous pressure of academics & performing well, the expectations of parents, the overdue homework, the reprimand of the teachers, the responsibility to grow up and earn.

He could not bear this burden.

And if he is able to solve these, then what? Death?

He went into a frenzy.

The temptation was too great.

He rolled the dice.

Inevitably, it landed on “one”.

The World ended into blissful oblivion.

The problems were gone.

Forever.
