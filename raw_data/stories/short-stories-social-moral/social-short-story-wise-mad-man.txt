There lived a man called Uttam in a village  Chikkodi which is located in Karnataka. The whole Chikkodi would make fun of Uttam and called him mad, as every person in the village had  noticed Uttam talking to himself most of the time. 

Uttam could imagine what people think about him in the village and without any agitation he would be friendly with everyone. Inspite of people pretending to be good infront and talk behind his back.

Uttam had some special powers which nobody could understand except him.He could listen and speak to spirits and these friendly spirits would come to him and have regular conversations. While Uttam  talks to spirits the whole village would think he’s talking to himself. Nobody knew or had the curiosity to ask Uttam, whom do you talk too? and Uttam never felt the necessity to tell anybody, even if he tells they would still say he is mad.

One day these friendly spirits come and warn Uttam to vacate the place and go to nearby place called Athani.Tomorrow there will be a natural disaster which will occur in Chikkodi  were people may die. 

Now Uttam was completely distressed and talked to every person he met in the village to warn them. Everybody acknowledged this very ignorantly and neglected. Uttam was very heavy hearted that he was unable to convince people and help them. A fist full of people who genuinely felt that he is trying to help, they  travelled along with him to Athani. 

Next day in the news it appeared they were close to 23 people who died in Chikkodi due to earthquake. After 2 days when the situation was completely under control . Uttam returned back to Chikkodi from Athani. People who believed  and followed him, they thanked him and said “you are our  saviour” and the rest of the people in the village completely changed their point of view towards Uttam after this incident.
