Every human being has been blessed with a special and strong feeling. And, that feeling can not be overcome by himself. Infact, he needs to overcome it to focus on his task. That feeling is the sexual feelings which take place in a student mostly when he has a book in his hand with a mind not willing to study something.

Behlul was teenager. He had his first day at his C/A institution. He entered with high hopes but he didn’t know it wasn’t that easy to get through. He passed his previous exams with quite ease but that wasn’t as easy as abc.

Days passed by and he made many friends. He had a friend who was not a good person at all. Both of them used to watch such movies and clips which arouse their sexual feeling to an extent that they could no longer concentrate in their studies.

Behlul’s nights turned into a cinema with a device in his hands and his eyes staring on the screen.

His concentration power was reduced and he couldn’t concentrate on the dry books of accounting. His imaginations reached their peak in his exams and wanted to get married without setting up his career. At last, the day came when he got the result.

He got failed. From that day and onward he never and ever watched such bad things again. He also left his bad friend who made him follow wrong path.

He studied with such a concentration that after completion of his degree with good grades, he got an excellent job. Then he got married with a beautiful and caring girl. They lived happily ever after.

So, there is a right time for everything friends. For all the students, i would like to say that be careful in watching videos on internet. Bad videos can leave an everlasting impact on your personality and life hereafter.
