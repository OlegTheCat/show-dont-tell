There was a time when God had two faithful servants, “

”, Dream and Nightmare were best of friends, always together helping out God in several matters. God’s greatest creations were humans, who were beginning to roam Earth. But, humans lacked ambitions. For that God created achievement, its God’s thought as to drive humans towards achievement. But, God never anticipated one thing, Dream and Nightmare’s drive towards achievement. Dream and Nightmare as best of friends still wanted achievement for themselves. Since human lacked ambition, fear, motivation and attitude so God decided to release his best servants on the planet Earth to help humans to drive towards their destiny. He gave order to “Dream and Nightmare” to lead humans to continuous achievement and God’s will was humans to decide with whom achievement should be related. With this order and their ambition Dream and Nightmare set out for a quest on Earth.

Nightmare’s best ability was imparting fear and hatred on enemies. He started driving humans imparting fear and hatred on other fellow human beings to achieve their destiny. Nightmare’s drive was such that fear and hatred of one human being made other human being a lesser entity with that one’s achievement always over shadowed others.

Dream on the other hand was always calm and clear minded. His influence on humans was very slow instead of deciding on their behalf he started imparting ideas, he gave them creativity, with these humans started achieving their destiny. The impact of Dream on humans is such that, humans started dreaming more and were not satisfied with only one achievement.

Nightmare developed fear of failure on humans which made humans to achieve less, on the other hand Dream with its creativity and ambition nudged humans to achieve greater thing for greater good. For this human always relate achievement to Dream.
