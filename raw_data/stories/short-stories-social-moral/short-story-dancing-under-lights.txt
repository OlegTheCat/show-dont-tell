[Dancing Under Lights – Short Story]

Dancing Under Lights - Short Story

Back on my knees again, I was a goner, their voices roared my defeat, blood, dripping on the canvas now, even I was convinced it was time, lights flashed in eyes, and I could barely make out those five fingers, “Six” he shouted, I saw them change, one  more came out. Not much was left to fuel a revenge, swaying back against gravity, I lifted the world on my shoulder back on my feet now, product of my iron will , “you got some courage boy!”, I didn’t fuss to look in the crowed to invite the hypocrite to join me but attention was focusing on getting the night through alive.

“Fight!”…he came rushing in like an express train, as if  late, on that note, I was, according to his calculations I was supposed to be out four rounds a gone… A  cold fist smashed against my jaw, fading my world in an out of darkness, it was the lights though, above us that had me going, coach said if  you look at it frequently during the fight, that means the fight was close to end, he landed a few dozen more, and every time he landed one it was as if  I was receiving it for the first time, slipping from the ropes, by his permission, I danced around the ring, the kind of dance only mad men can scientifically replicate, I was dancing in weary fatigue, I decided to take a rest on the ropes again, and he continued his assault, this time it was on the ribs, even my mother during my days never whipped me so terribly, well that’s the price the world’s best  would have to pay, the eagle sees nothing but a clear sky high up above, diving down is where the possibility of  free falling is at work, after clipping your wings of course.

I continued my little dance,  he was staring into my eyes, I could feel the beat coming to its end, my leg grew weak, my world caved in on its thin ice, resting against the rope I watched the lion come in for the kill, pulling his hand behind him, he sucked up all the energy  from deep down within, I saw in coming in slow motion, my head jerked up, I was starring right into the  lights up above, when I realized I was l back on the canvas, coach would always tell them when ‘the next thing you should happen is that you would hear a…”……… Ding ding!!!! (Bell ringing).

THE END.
