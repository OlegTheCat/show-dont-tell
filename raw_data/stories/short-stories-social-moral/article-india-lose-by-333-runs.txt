So many amazing cricket matches I have watched earlier played during the year 2015 and 2016 till now but this first test match played in Pune is quite different from all other matches played till now and there is no wrong to say it is an amazing win by Australian Team after 12 years, 4 months and 11 Test Matches inasmuch as their last win is recorded in Nagpur Test on 29th. November 2004.

 How such defeat happened, only God knows, none else, but one thing is clear as crystal that it so happened that on one hand Australian Team played extremely beyond anybody’s imagination and on the other Indian Team played extremely poorly due to which from both the sides or angles India could made 105 runs and 107 runs – almost the same in the first and second innings respectively.

 Australia made 260 runs in the first innings whereas India all out at the total of 105 runs only. The most shocking rather surprising incident (It happens in cricket matches but rarely) that India was 94 for 4 and after that within the total of merely 11 runs all the rest 7 wickets were gone leaving behind Ishant Sharma not out being the eleventh player and making 2 runs in 5 balls.

 None could even imagine that the fall of the rest 7 wickets in hand would result in a few minutes at the total of merely 105 runs.

 Australia made 285 runs in the second innings out of which the major contribution was 109 runs in 202 ball with 11 fours, no six by S. Smith.

 Thus Australia could close at the grand total of 545 runs in both the innings.

 Indian Team came to the playground – hope against hope that they could face the situation and could make satisfactory total but in vain, once again had to surrender to the excellent bowling of Steve O’ Keefe who took 6 wickets once again in the second innings too.

 India could make 107 runs only, none could score more than 31 runs in this second innings.

 Australia made:

 1. 1st. Innings – 260 runs

 2. 2nd. Innings – 285 runs = Total runs = 545

 India made:

 1st. Innings – 105 runs

 2nd. Innings – 107 runs = Total runs = 212

 Australia defeat India by 333 runs and lead by 1-0 in the first test match, the rest to be played later.

 Steve O’ Keefe’s 12/70 is the best match bowling record in a Test by an Aussie bowler against India bettering Alan Davidson’s 12/124 in Kanpur in December 1959.

 His second best by any bowler against India just behind Ian Bonham’s 13/106 in Mumbai in February 1980.

 In cricket nothing can be predicted as it is the game of uncertainty. Anything can happen with any player or any team, no player or team can be blamed or held responsible for poor performance coupled with exceptional defeat.

 Virat Kohli – the roaring lion of the team accepted this defeat reasonably that it was owing to judgement error that he could not perform to the expectation of the people and returned to the pavilion scoring a few runs in both the innings.

 It is a game and not only the players but spectators too should take defeat at par with win and do not think otherwise or react otherwise.

 Most of the cricket lovers and I too appreciate the Australian team for their excellent performance and his spin bowler Steve O’Keefe who was declared “Man of the Match.” for his brilliant bowling in both the innings that led the team to the gigantic win by 333 runs in the first test match.

 Next Test Match is scheduled to be held in Bangalore.

 Do hope Indian Team under the captaincy of Virat Kohli will do better.

 Congratulation to Steve O’ Keefe!

 Congratulation to the Australian Team!
