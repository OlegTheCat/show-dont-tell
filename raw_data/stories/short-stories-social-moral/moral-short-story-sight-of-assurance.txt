Moral Short Story – Sight of assurance!

I went to Kondwa that day. My painting class fling drove me where not!

I was learning coffee painting this time. Drops of coffee, with water and brush, waited from eternity for me to declare their union. I did my task, unknowingly, great.

After 4 hours of continuous session, I was on my way back home. Totally relying on the Public transport, I was waiting at the bus station for the bus to Kalyaninagar.

While I was waiting for the bus, I saw an old women, with a 5-6 year old kid. Grandson, evidently.

 She desired to go to the same destination as mine, so the conductor asked her to follow me. We exchanged smiles, and I assured with it that I will take care of her, henceforth. I was handicapped linguistically ( well, shamefully even after 4 years of my education on the soil of Maharashtra ), but I guess my expressions did the talk. So, whatever!

I still had time, the time table said. So, I moved to a nearby 

to grab a 

(Tea in half in quantity metrics). Me being out of sight, my subject ( The Old women ) got anxious and looked around for me. I returned, and gave my trophy-winning expression of assurance, again!

Bus arrived, and as usual, I moved towards the lonely, back window seat; which somehow gives me solace, allowing me to meet myself in journeys long. Looking out of the window, capturing the passing snapshots of others life, where you don’t get to know the flow, yet you can create your own interpretation of the happenings.

When i returned from my trance and looked inside the bus, I found a gaze, politely commanding me to take the seat before hers. It insisted, and I couldn’t say no. I was her assurance, of her reaching the destination securely, soundly.

I liked that feeling of warmth, the feeling of being possessed, by a stranger.

 Simple. Pure.
