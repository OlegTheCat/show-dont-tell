 form often brings lots of loathing and swearing from the passersby’s, which got hurt by 

 pointing edges or seems to be baffled that

heart sinks & spirits go awry.

 The aged Pipal tree was 

 consolation, to provide comfort & shade, in 

 half-struck luck.

As an Infant, 

was so chirpy, energetic, enthusiastic & full of hopes. As the time fly,

 Sometimes, laborers from construction site & their children, try to decompress 

 from many places, through shovel & pelting other pointed stones on

shiny & crusty appearance looks somewhat disheveled. Pointy edges have been given place to rough side corners, broken edges & forlorn appearance on 

 always smiling face.
