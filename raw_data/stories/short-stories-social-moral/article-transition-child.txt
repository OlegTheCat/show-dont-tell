Juju was a happy go lucky kid. Born in a rich middle class family. His family provided him with everything. When he was fifteen he was gifted with a computer. He was happy for it.His parents thought he would be intelligent & brilliant. But as time went by his grades started falling.He was not seen outside anymore.He even stopped listening to his parents.He was rude.Finally he stopped going to school.Strange noises were heard from his room.He could nt leave his computer chair.Hours and hours of gaming.His parents grew worried.His siblings interfered.Nothing could be done.he grew violent.Later his parents talked with him.started spending more time with him.so was with his friends & other family friends.

The vacuum he created was filled.Soon he was close to normal.
