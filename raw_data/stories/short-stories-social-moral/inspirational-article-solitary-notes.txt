Discourage…deter…dishearten…depress…disappoint…deject…

These ‘D’s revolved around me like the Earth goes around the sun. Loneliness killed nearly a part of me and these solitary words just gave me a sigh of temporary relief. I did not know where my life led me but I was sure that I will reach a height in my life where no one can even see me from their place. I told the same last line to my mind and heart again and again but in vain. Because those ‘D’s suppressed, squeezed and squashed me like crushing a load of clothes inside a small bag.

I could not take any more D’s to me. I was done completely . I really hated myself for being in this world full of D’s. Many a times, I thought of doing something good and useful but it all ended up in failure. Nothing seemed to support me or encourage me. I was in solitude. Even music, whatsapp status and facebook stories did not help me with a little bit of consolation.

Then, I realized the bitter and universal truth about life. “Only you can make yourself happy”. I sat in one corner of my room with my stuffs and I built a beautiful environment for myself. I worked as if I am the only person existed in this world. I stopped caring about those D words of others than myself. I gave the best motivation to myself and I started talking a lot to myself. At one point, I felt myself like a pro in giving motivation. My biggest inspiration was none other than me at that time.

Slowly I started to work on everything with a better concentration and confidence than before. It gave me a shade of hope in my world of gloom. I regained all my lost love for me and love for everything. Out of the blue, people with D words showed their appreciation and recognition to me. Then I remembered this quote “Don’t be afraid of CHANGE. Its leading you to a new and good beginning”. Its true. That one step of courage to change myself changed my entire life. This may work for you too :)
