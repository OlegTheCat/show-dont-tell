Women in India,weaker than men. REALLY??? I do not agree! While in my history classes back in the VII grade, I read about how the women enjoyed equal status and rights during the early Vedic Period

And now IN the scenario of modern independent India fully participate in all the spheres of the national concern from politics to media to NGOs. Women empowerment in India gained momentum in the late 1970s due to the infamous Mathura gang rape. Formation of women NGOs, reforms etc gave the required push. In spite of everything women still have to fight hard to get niche in the society. Their competence and talent gets unnoticed due to make domination,still.

A Woman should themselves realize their worth and stand up for both herself and fellow women. I personally feel women can do any given job better than the best of the man in any given field. INDIA should do whatever it takes to combat any injustice againsta women of all classes and the call of the hour is the safety of woman, looking at the data of crimes against woman.

I have ever seen,understood the power that comes with being a women i strongly feel what Virginia Woolf wrote:

“Women have served all these centuries as looking glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of a man at twice its natural size.”

Writing about women empowerment is a never ending topic, the content of it no matter how long or short the write up is that women should know :

“The thing women have yet to learn is nobody gives you power. You just take it.” — Roseanne Barr
