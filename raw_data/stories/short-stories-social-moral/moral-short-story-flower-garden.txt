Short Story Moral – The Flower Garden

 from 

A man, on one of his weekend, sitting in his house garden and was thinking about his future and his current life at work.

Why am I being stressed out so much that I started to hate my life, why is this only happening to me, where as I could see others are happy around me..

He was speaking to himself on the above lines, and was walking in and around his house garden. Suddenly, he looks at the flowers that are planted in his garden, and he looked at them closely, and he could see that they were glowing and looked beautiful and admirable.

He says to himself; let me spend some time with the flowers to refresh/relax myself.

He reached out his hand to pluck one of the flowers and unfortunately it hurt his finger with the thorn that the flower was carrying in her stem. It hurt him and a little drop of blood came out of his finger, he turned up to see the flower again and the way the flower looked, unknowingly he forgot the pain and gave a glimpse of smile to the flower.

The man went back inside his house and was washing his hand under the tap, and slowly started to think and realise, that everyone has problems, but it is left to an individual how to take their life forward during their hard times in life.

Look at the flower it gives smile on other face, but how much pain does it take to grow with the thorn, the flower has grown with thorns, but still managed to look beautiful and make others smile….

The man simply left the house went to his garden and sat next to the flower and talking to himself, saying, I will not gripe in my life hereafter, no matter whatever happens, I will carry a face and heart to be cheerful and lead a life of rejoice.
