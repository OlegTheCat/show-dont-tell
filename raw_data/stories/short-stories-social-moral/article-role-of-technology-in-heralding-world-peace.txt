With the improvement in technology the job of an individual in his day-to-day life is becoming easier.Most of the people in the world are busy in their life and they don’t have time to seek into global issues like World Peace but it is an important factor in keeping the lives of individuals in a normal way.If the world peace is disturbed then it effects most of the people.

The Modern Technology is playing an important role in promoting World Peace in either ways of both constructive and destructive nature.The improvement in technology in one country may promote peace in another country by helping them to improve their technology but this improvement may even result in de-promoting the world peace if there is improvement of weapon technology which may be used against other countries.

The crimes committed by an individual or a group of people of one country against another country like terrorism using modern technology effects the peace between those countries.The world peace may also be disturbed when some countries go against the rules posed by the UNO.

Technology can promote world peace to a great extent if different countries come and work together in developing modern technologies in a mutually benefiting way that is useful for the development of their nations.The importance of world peace can be explained and developed among the people easily using technology.The commitment of each and every individual in the country to follow the rules is very important in maintaining the world peace.

Development of technology in weapons is a major threat in maintaining the world peace.For example,if a country develops a bomb which can destroy an area of around 10 km circumference then their rival countries may develop bombs which may destroy area of more than 10 km and the use of these new weapons cause great destruction in peace.

 So, technology can be used in both maintaining as well as destroying peace.People must be educated about the use of technology for their development and the importance of maintaining world peace,they must be aware of the loss caused by destroying world peace.

“Technology may help in maintaining peace in an individual which result in maintaining the World Peace but it depends on the way we use it”.

 “What can you do to promote world peace?

 Go home and love your family”- Mother Theresa
