Article on New Year – Hello World

 from 

A lot to say, a lot to share,

 A lot to know and to care,

 A lot to learn, a lot to give,

 A lot of things for which to live…

A new world, a new place,

 A lot of thoughts to interlace,

 A new beginning to a story,

 For a life full of glory!!

We are born with this mix,

 We are born to repair & fix,

 A baby so innocent, so true,

 It still lives in me & you!!

So go, get up from your sleep,

 Free yourself from your own grip,

 The world out there is waiting for you,

 Catch those dreams and make them true!!

We all have some aspirations,some dreams, some distant future that we want to make true for ourselves. The minute a baby is born, it opens its eyes to a whole new world and sparks of dreams enter its eyes. The above words are a reflection of the feelings that a person goes through in his/her lifetime. But the course of our daily lives and the new things that we learn everyday compel us, force us to see the reality and bring us swooping down to the world we actually live in. In this process, the actual dreams that we all see and live in our imaginary world are lost. This short poetry is for awakening those dreams buried like fossils, deep within the years of “real world experiences”.

With the New Year just ahead of us, this poetry, these words will hopefully help us all become aware of our inner buried desires and dreams and let us know that we have some reason to being born in this world.

The title “Hello World” is the reminder that the day we were born, we had now clue of the actual world and its default working conditions. We welcomed the world with open arms and eyes full of energy and passion. It is time we turn back to that time and let the world know that we are back!!
