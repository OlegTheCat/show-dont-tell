It was becoming very hard for him to hold back his tears, but somehow he managed to hold them back. Now he was all alone with a pigeon watching him from a distant tree. He looked around himself and saw the trees of different colors standing side by side. They were no more green. The leaves seemed weak and ill due to cold. The season had come, the season of death for them. The little boy with his wet eyes stared at the bulging soil for the last time. Rain had started to fall and the cruel wind separated the weak and ill leaves from their beloved branches.

The small boy started for his house with rain falling heavily making an annoying sound. Now the tears were running down his beautiful red cheeks. He remembered how the autumn season had separated him from his beloved. As he walked back to his house everyone stared at him, but he had no fears because the rain wiped the tears off his face.

‘Yes, autumn really is a cruel season’ the boy thought. But as the tree carry on its life without those leaves and even without cursing the autumn season, the boy had to do the same.

Ashfaq read all those words with tears running down his face. At the end of the page was his father’s name. His grandfather had died when his father was just a boy, in the season of autumn. Ashfaq took out a pen from his pocket with trembling hands and wrote down on that sheet of paper.

YES, AUTUMN REALLY IS A VERY CRUEL SEASON. IT SEPARATES THOSE BELOVED LEAVES FROM THE BRANCHES.

The soil was wet with tears where he was sitting. Looking down at the bulging soil with a stone fixed in the middle, he cursed the cold and the cruel season of autumn.
