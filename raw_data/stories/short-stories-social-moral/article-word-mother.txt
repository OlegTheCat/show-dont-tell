Hey everyone,

Dev here! First, I’d like to introduce myself as I just joined this site. I’m a fourteen year old blogger from India, I like to read stories, make them and of course my main inspiration was my mother. She helped me a lot with my education, because of her I got interested in writing.

As you know, or maybe you don’t. The word ‘Mother’ is a very strong word, and in this article I am going to show you how strong the word is.

So, what’re you waiting for? Let’s start.

It is strong word for us, because why not? A mother is who takes care of us, who wakes us up for school and helps us out with our main problems.

We’re always rude with our mother, but did we notice? They work hard for us, and yet we still act rude. We’re sometimes angry with her, but did we notice? She stays up all night thinking about us, so all we need is a mother who takes care of us, feeds us and of course she is always there to support us. I’m lucky to have a mother, because she is the best. That’s the word I would always recommend for a mother. Few days ago, I had a fight with my mother and she got very angry, and started ignoring me. She told me that I can use everything without her permission or even do things without her permission.

I was like, I am free! I continued to do things without her permission, It felt really good. But, after that I began to feel lonely and I used to miss how she used to scream at me. I used to cry every night thinking about her, she never talked to me, even a bit. I knew the word ‘sorry’ wasn’t enough, I knew I had to do something good. So,  I thought of writing her a letter of how sorry I was. But, I never wrote it because I knew that words do not have emotion.

I stepped near her, said ‘sorry’. It was a emotional break down for me, I cried a lot, I missed her  a lot. I regretted for the things I did to hurt her, because she used to work every night in her laptop sitting with her broken glass, just for my education and that’s how I repay her? I was like, that’s a terrible way to repay her, I was expecting her to forgive me and SHE REALLY DID! I was so happy, I broke down in happiness just thinking about her.

The only thing I’d recommend is that, just don’t hurt your mother the way I did, because that is the most terrible I ever did in my entire life. The reason I hurt her with? Oh, well, I was not listening to her. She was screaming, still I was not listening to her, isn’t that terrible? She works the entire night, and that’s how I repay her? Even if she forgave me, I’ll still regret it my entire life.

Thank you for reading my story, the last thing I would like to say is that never hurt your mother because she is the most important thing in your whole life.
