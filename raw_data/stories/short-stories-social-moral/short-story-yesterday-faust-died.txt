Short Story – Yesterday Faust died

Yesterday Faust died and I was sincerely upset. My world ended suddenly and the place where I was during all the last year didn’t exist any more. I remembered Winherrs, our neighbours in tenetment how they lost their place. I am sure, dear reader, you will never pity them, but I did it many years ago. I was five years old and my right to jaw was strongest in the yard and their eldest daughter was seven years old and had beautiful golden hair. I dug dirt all days long until once she came out to the yard and I began to observe her hair. From that day I waited her for hours, but didn’t dare to approach. When boy called Marat tried to hit her my strong right was helpful as always. My world changed from dirt to beauty and her hair did this. I did nothing, but observed her hair all days and was in high spirits. I don’t remember now how long it was, but after this I was put in dirt again. People that put you in dirt always say they wish the best for you and want to teach you a lesson. My mom was expert in this.

-Do you know, who is she?- asked mom.

-No,- answered I,- Does it interest you?

-Of course. She is a daughter of German soldier. He killed many Russian soldiers. He was sentenced for that and was in jail, but it doesn’t matter.

-We aren’t Russians, we are Jews.

-Germans killed millions of Jews during the second world war,- she took out an old photo,- Here is your grandpa, killed in 1942 in Krim.

I glanced over and was pleased. My grandpa was in field uniform without cap and his eyes clearly told me that he considered himself very lucky fellow. This was my first lesson after which I went out to the yard and awaited Iren till evening, but she didn’t come out. My second lesson took place too soon. It was midday yet and I ought to be outside.

-Our closest neighbour is veteran of the war and I visit him often,- began mom looking to my eyes and then continued,- He is slowly dying from gangrene in his leg, because he refused amputation. He was tankist all the war and he told me how hard was to him to kill people in the beginning of the war and how easy he did it in the end. He was amazed at himself even. His leg was shot in the end of the war before new deployment.

-Oh, no! – thought I, really pitying that man. I pitied him not because he was slowly dying, but because in such state he was unable to choose his visitors.

Next morning when I was going downstairs I saw father Winherr and greeted him as usual, but he didn’t answer me. His face was pale from fear when he hid his look from me and he hurried downstairs. I was so upset that sat down on the ground in the yard and sat there till evening, slowly scratching the ground. I couldn’t think any more, I just waited. Iren appeared at last looking unusually tired. She was walking slowly, trying to avoid everybody and returned home pretty soon. In less than month Winherrs moved and everyone forgot them except me.
