Growing up things were normal. Or at least they seemed normal to me and others in my family. Mom took care of the house, dad went to work, my siblings and I went to school and played in the yard. after a few years of going through elementary school, I realized that “Hey why doesn’t everyone else hang out with me”, and “why don’t I get to go over their houses like the other kids?”, which really bugged me. I would sit inside the house, or just go pay in the yard each and every day. But every time I would try to go to a friend’s or try to have someone over, my parents wouldn’t let it happen, and as a child you just let it go and never think about it.

By the time I had hit the end of elementary school and even the start of middle school, I realized I had no idea what all the other kids were talking about. They would have phones and text each other or call each other and talk about make-up and movies, while I would sit there and unable to understand what was going on. While I had paper and pencils, everyone else had the new gaming systems and their own computers. Though when you’re a low-income family you get used to not having much, but it slowly started to feel like the world around me was a whole new realm.

Once middle school had started, I started to lie about things to my friends, or at least to gain some friends. Everyone else was having experiences with people, and I had to just nod and look everything up on Google. Even through high school, I would throw myself out there at people and still lie because I had no idea. To this day, after being tossed around by a bunch of jerks over the years, I still don’t know much and it gets confusing.
