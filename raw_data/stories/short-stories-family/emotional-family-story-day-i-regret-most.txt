It is not the story of a boy or girl who is in love and could not express his/her feelings before it got too late. It is the story of a daughter who regrets the day that she could not be at her father’s side at the time of his last breathe.

Everything was just going fine that day, I was very excited as I was going to attend my cousin’s marriage out of town and that was the last moment when I bid bye to my father whom I love most. I had a blast attending marriage ceremonies, dancing, eating lot of sweets, roaming around here and there and enjoying every moment of the marriage. One phone call, and my enjoyment was put to halt.

That was one of the horrible night I have ever spent and lived. He’s sinking – that was the message, but he already had his last breath, I wasn’t told. My world shattered, life seemed stopped that very moment.  Travelling all the way back to my home to my father, was such longest journey I have every had, longest way I have ever travelled. I travelled just to see my father lying on floor, covering his face.

The day I will always regret that I was not there when he breath his last, I was not there to listen to him, I was not there to hold his hand and say you will be fine papa, I will not let you go…I could not say anything to him, I could not listen what all he probably wanted to say. I could not feel what would have been going in his mind and heart….the day I regret coz I had lived the most painful day…today he is not there, but I can always feel him around him. The day I regret most..coz now I can only feel my father but can’t lean over his shoulder, can’t sleep over his lap, THE DAY I REGRET MOST……
