Family Short Story – THE BLACKOUT

 from 

It was a normal day like any other. My brother Larry was playing the game he just bought the other day for his PS4. My mom was actually pretty annoyed and wanted him to stop playing it all day, after all his final exams were just a week away. But somehow he had managed to convince dad that he was perfectly prepared for his exams the next week and mom had nothing to worry. And that gave him the right to play all day all night.

On the other hand my exams were already over and I had pretty results to show for it. So I was pretty much watching The big bang theory and playing Pes 2015 because Fifa was broken. And I was having the best time of my life until my PS4 went black, I was pretty sure it crashed as I was playing for 12 hours straight.

But I realized what it was when I heard my brother screaming”Oh,come on” down the hall. The power was out. My brother was furious made my mom call the electricity provider or manager or whatever it was. After our mom called we found out what it was. And it sure was not pleasant as my brother shouted out”Why me?????”,

It was a blackout. Our dad was the lucky he was out for a conference to LA. Well as 3 hours passed since the power was gone and it seemed that the power was going to be restored the next morning. So we had the rest of the night to pass.

As time went on and the temperature seemed to rise inside so we decided to go on the roof and chill out. So we went to the roof and guess what everybody from all the blocks were already up. And alas it was a night with a lot of people on rooftop.
