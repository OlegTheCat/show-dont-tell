Hi friends, here I am back with a true story of a family – I Miss You. In a small town of Maharashtra there lived a husband wife and a daughter but the neighbors noticed that the family was not happy ever there was a sorrow in their faces  that lasted forever so many used to ask them what is the reason  but silence was their answer but my friend wanted to know the truth behind the silence as he slowly entered into their lives to find out he found out that the whole family was in a shock of losing their younger daughter in a mela 5 years ago they searched every where and could not find her a police complaint was also launched but no one could bring back the girl .

no one knew whether she is still alive but the mother did not loose hope she felt that one day I will meet my daughter back . Days passed by she went on visiting  temples churches mosques just hoping for a miracle to take place. She was in Karnataka at a temple praying when she saw a family passing by with a kid something went into her mind she felt cold vibes running in her body she followed the family and met the kid and had a strong feeling that it is her lost  daughter she lost the kid when she was 2 years old its seven years since. immediately she contacted her husband who was in the hotel room and asked  him to come to the temple they inquired about the kid with her parents but something was not correct so they decided to go to the police an investigation was setup lots of people were questioned and many details were examined finally the case was solved the kid really  belonged to the parents who lost their child the people who had the child were those who found the child many years ago at the same mela and as they had no children they felt it was gods gift to them and decided to bring up the child they loved the child very much and kept her very happy the child was also very much in love with its parents but

now comes the difficult part the separation .the parents who lost and found their child after many years insisted on taking the child back with them but the child and the parents who brought it up were very sad the child who does not know what to do whether it is going to live with its original parents or those who had her for so many years  friends what would have the child wanted to happen so lets ask our self how would u like to end this triangular love story with passion keeping in point of view the child and both parent parties

good bye for now
