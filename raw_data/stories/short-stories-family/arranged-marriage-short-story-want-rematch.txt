Short Story on Arranged Marriage – I want a Rematch..

Growing up around a bunch of boys has it own pluses and minuses. There wasn’t any guy in our locality who would dare to pass a comment on me in my growing up years. I enjoyed being so secure and protected by my brothers. I was the only girl in a family of around 15 boys. Not all 15 were my siblings but my cousins and so on. God, my dad would have to be Lalu Prasad to raise 15 kids otherwise :P

Anyways, other than the extra love and the almost suffocating care that I was abundantly showered with, I was also privy to typical male dominated games/sports viz. Football, cricket and of course wrestling. When I first started watching wrestling, it scared me. Bunch of people throwing each other off the rink. But then I started to notice that they are just doing a little dangerous version of what my brothers do to each other! As I grew up I participated in plenty of sports events. My mother was always scared that I might grow up as a tomboy. I did grow up to be a pretty strong girl.

It was around my third year of college, our College day was being celebrated. An entire week dedicated to celebrations, and even friends and families of the students were invited. Me and some of my friends heard a huge noise from our canteen, when we went there, it was an arm wrestling competition going on. I readily joined the league. First two rounds were fairly easy to win. But the final was against a guy, he was not so tall and not so tough looking, but as they say, looks can be deceitful. So I braced myself and went against him. It was really a tough match, but I somehow managed to win. People would say it was because someone diverted his concentration, so what if that someone was my friend :P. I won on my own, I won over a boy. That was good enough for me. As me and my friends were celebrating, a guy came forward and said,

I just shrugged and moved away with my friends. He called out again,

This made me furious. I was about to burst on him when I got a call from my mom. This was her fifth call in last two hours. She wanted me to come home before 5 P.M., as some guests were coming home. She knew I hated it, I hated being presented in front of their friends like a trophy and that’s why she kept calling every now and then so that I don’t bail out. But I still couldn’t go without replying,

 saying this I made my way out to go home, it was almost 4.30 PM. I couldn’t understand who the guy was, he definitely wasn’t from my college, may be someone’s brother or so.

At my home, everyone was dressed up and there were lots of dishes being prepared, this gave me a hint about what was going on. I went straight to the kitchen and asked my mom,

My dad came in by that time and said, 

’ I started to say something, but my dad cut me in between and said, 

My mom asked me to wear my best dress, which I reluctantly did, just to avoid any further discussion on this matter. At around 5.30 PM they arrived. I was to go out only when my mum calls me, and not before.

It was almost after half an hour that my mum called me out. As I entered the room, Shaila aunty hugged me and started to talk. She complimented my dress and then we had some casual talks about my studies and all. She then introduced me to her son. I was stunned to see him. He was the guy from college, who I had a spat with just a couple of hours ago. His name was Sampark, but Shaila aunty called him Sam. He still had the same grin he had when we first met. I was furious. But had to control.

After some casual talks, dad asked me to show him my room. I had to oblige against my will. When we entered my room, he let out a loud

I asked angrily

He said,

 I spat out.

He just mellowed down and said,

 I just nodded without looking at him, his stupid grin was irritating me.

They set up a table and sat against each other. It was the first time he noticed her big brown eyes, and that she crinkled her nose when concentrating on anything. They placed their elbows on the table, locked their arms and then he gave the count, one two three, start.

Both of them were concentrating on the game, putting all their strength in the game. She was stronger than he expected. She was finding it difficult in maintaining her stance. She feared that she would lose easily in another minute or so. Her face gave away this anxiety. when he noticed her face, he felt a strange feeling, she was looking vulnerable and a bit nervous. She was now pushing herself, putting all her strength in it. Beads of sweat started to appear on her forehead. She wasn’t ready to lose, not to a boy, more so not to HIM. She closed her eyes trying to concentrate her energy. Sam was taking things lightly at the start but then he noticed how much effort she was putting and he was giving her a tough challenge. When she opened her eyes she saw Sam smiling at her, this made her furious for some reason, she put all her strength and was able to shake his arm. This was it, with more push she finally slammed his hand on the table. She won. He was still smiling. ‘

 she protested.

He smiled and said, 

 She stormed out of her room. Sam followed her. She composed herself before reaching the living room. When her mom asked her, if she wanted to move forward with this alliance, she just nodded in agreement. Sam was surprised to see this. There were lots of laughter, hugs and congratulation in the room. they were made to sit together, and then everyone fed them some sweets. He was looking at her, trying to figure out her expression, at last he asked, 

 she winked. And they let out a laugh together.
