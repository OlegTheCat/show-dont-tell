Family Short Story – Good bye

I always wondered why we say it as a ‘good bye’ not just ‘bye’. I know farewells can be sad and tearful so why the name ‘good’. When i was diagnosed with cancer I had this funny feeling how will I tell good bye to my son when I know I may not be there for his sixth birthday or high school graduation. And how will he look in a mustache.

I will pray for him to have good life. The day he was born is a clear picture framed front of me. Truly life is so special, where every moment should be cherished. I wish had more to spend with him. I would have taken to his favorite ice creams and see him eat it and clean his tiny nose smudged with ice cream.I will miss him sharing his stories about the monsters in the jungle.

I remember the day I promised him I will take him to the beach and we will make sand castles.I wish I could tell him I won’t be next year to take him to the beach.

And who will kiss his hand when it gets hurt.I wish had another chance.I would have read him his favourite books.And walk him to the park,look at him climb the monkey bar,slide down the slide,make new friends .I wish I had more…

So final farewells cannot be good after all.Good bye are meant for people who will see one another again n again.Not for people like for whom it will be only once before I close my eyes.

I heart goes out to the people who share my pain. We have to live in today. I hug my son so much and each kiss to his is like a million kisses which will hopefully not cover a lifetime.

Good bye my son!
