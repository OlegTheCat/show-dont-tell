Family Short Story – My Journey of 34 years

A cry, oh it is me … I am a girl.

Two hands held me and kissed my forehead, I know the touch, and it is familiar. I cannot hear and see properly as receptors are not functional yet to their capacity. Days passed and whenever those two hands touched me I felt delighted.

I started to see/hear with some difficulty in focusing. A month passed and I hear faint sounds, lot of sounds.  Suddenly I realised I am being played by many hands, ah it is hurting. I cry again and those two hands touched me again. I felt secured. I want those two hands around me all the time.

I begin to hear and see and often found two girls hovering around me. Who are they?  Often wondered but in vain as I could only cry and giggle that time.

I hear a lullaby, and it’s time for me to sleep. I felt a touch on my forehead and hear someone say, my baby. The voice was familiar again. Who are these people around me?

I hear same voices and touch each day.

And as days passed, I found out that it is my family.

The hands that held me when I cried for the first time are my Mom’s. The other voice which often says, “my baby” is my Dad. The two girls who always hovered around me are my Sisters.

Wow, I am happy.

The awesome threesome always rocked with Mom and Dad.

Days, months, years passed.

Suddenly I realise I don’t hear these voices often. The touch, the lullaby is missing too.

No, the lullaby is still here as my son wants to sleep now. I sang the same lullaby and he is asleep in no time.

I am happy again and it stays as I watch my son sleep!
