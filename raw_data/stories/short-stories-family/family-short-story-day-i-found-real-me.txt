After a quick sleepless night I arrived at the hospital all ready to have you. The nurses got me ready and asked me to wait it out till my doctor arrived.  I was super nervous and at the same time ready to hold you in my arms, after almost losing you at two and a half months I was more and more determined to show the world how perfect you must be. Our entire family and a few friends were there waiting patiently for you to arrive. Your dad was more nervous than I was but he tried his best to stay calm and collected.

Finally the time came to roll me into that operating room as I was being pushed through the doors I prayed silently for your wellbeing. The doctor came and reassured me that everything is going to be quick and smooth. She knew I must have been very worried after being operated on at two and a half months to remove a massive tumor which was obstructing your growth.

The anesthesia kicked in and I could hear the doctor asking someone to push down my breech baby. I felt a sudden jerk and they were all talking amongst themselves. Someone said, “Oh my how cute is he!” I thought I might have heard wrong; but then at that very moment I heard you cry. Excitement filled the air as a nurse came and confirmed that I had just delivered a little baby boy weighing almost 3kgs!

They bought you to me and you were the cutest little guy there! Tears filled my eyes and happiness filled my soul as I saw you. Outside in the waiting room you were the star of everyone’s eyes, the place was filled with relatives celebrating your birth. Our little prince was born that day. Healthy and happy full of life!

I realized that nothing in life could ever compare to being your mum. I found myself in you dear boy!
