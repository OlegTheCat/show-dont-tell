It was an unforgettable day for my parents, 22nd Oct 1988, when after so many prayers I was born. There was a huge celebration that day. They were celebrating without knowing the disaster that was waiting for them.

Days and months went by, I started to grow. Then my parents noticed that I was behaving abnormally. My gestures were different from other kids. Without wasting a minute, I was taken to a doctor. My parents were shocked to hear that I was in a state of mental retardation.

Doctor told that only 10 among 100 will have this abnormality. He told my parents to leave everything upon God. It may be the first time after my birth that my parents have cried. I was given a lot of medicine and was asked to take it continuously for 5 years. I was physically and mentally weak. But my parents didn’t lose their hope.

They gave me the best medicine and looked after me like a normal child. I started going to school. But unlike other children I didn’t have strength. My dad used to take me on his shoulder while going and coming from school. I wasn’t able to walk then. My parents had to hear make back wards from my family regarding my topic. Still they looked after and treasure me.

Gradually I started walking at the age of 5. You can call it as gods miracle or my parents effort, yes I also started living a normal life. My brain started developing. And see, right now I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineer and very talented in sports and arts. Am very great full to my parents who gave me a new life.

I also request every one not to leave your child if something goes wrong. Everything is possible with your will power and dedication.
