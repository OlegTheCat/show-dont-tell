Each one of us will have a story to tell.

Here is a story from a tier 2 town where he lived happily with mom,day and a brother. Dont know what is the reason for fight between mom and dad. But brought up with lot of quarrels, fightings, suicide attempts by mom.

 Bro got job and even got married to his loved one.

 Father didnt like it as he always wont.

 Want to see his wife and two sons depended on him and can treat them as slaves.

 Society didnt come to help us as dad is a good n nice gentleman in society and in higher position so no one dared to tell him to stop this.

 Mom always told to stand on our own feet and let him see that and think what he has done to the family.

 Its time for me, as i finished by schooling he told to get out of the house and earn.

 We had sufficient money, not at all required both of us to work for our life but he don’t want us to be there only reason being we are supporting mom.

 Left the house its almost 10 years now. Still he dont want us to be there with him. Far away from home got in touch with my love.

 But destiny changed my love, she is gone. I thought i have a life because of her. Once she is gone. I’m almost gone. Tried to commit suicide, friends stopped, addicted to smoking and drinking like anything. Times passed by i am slowly coming out of this tragedy.

 Life is not easy for anyone including me. Dad became so sadist, he kept mom in a room without giving any food, even locked the fridge in midsummer, not even possible to have a drop of water.

 Thought I should get back to my feet now. Ran to capital without any thing but with a HOPE on future that some day I will make sure that family cant be treated as slaves, they are meant to be for our lifes.

 Lot more to share will continue.
