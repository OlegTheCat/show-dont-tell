Diya’s eyes were blur with tears and the fear of her uncertain tomorrow that lay ahead of her at that moment as she sat helpless under the shower thinking about her to be ex husband and his family. She had wept a lot that day and that too after a long time. Since the last 3 days her bathroom had become her personal space of crying and finding peace both.

Her in-laws presence in her life was becoming like a dark eclipse that din’t seem to end. 3 days back she was very happy with her life that she was settling in her new job, was learning new things, making new friends and over all happy in her life that she was finally getting out of the depression of her divorce after almost 18 months of mind wrecking meetings and the counseling sessions that happened at the family court. She was beginning to live her freedom. Fulfilling her small wishes and pampering herself of simple pleasures of life.

But one phone call from a friend was all it took for her ex husband to spoil everything. A call that informed that her ex husband is spying on her.  Her confidence suddenly went down and frustration rised up. Since 3 days she was in her own world of frustration and when at home she yelled and annoyed everybody. She snapped at her niece for no reason. Today she felt the most disgusted of herself as she saw the “look of disappointment” in the only person whom she loved more than herself her MOM.

Finally wipping her tears Diya made a decision “to live in the present come what may”. She will move ahead pushing all her fears aside and live freely, spread love around her and not frustration. Finally Diya stood up got dressed and went to her mom hugged her and said I LOVE YOU MOM.
