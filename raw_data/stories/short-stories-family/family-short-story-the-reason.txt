Family Short Story – The Reason

Short Story of a Daughter – The Reason

I was sitting in my room with the door tightly shut and locked. Again.

I was trying very hard not to listen to anything but the beat of my own heart. But in vain.

Same old lines, same old threats. I’d grown tired of them arguing over and over again. Daddy wouldn’t change, and Mummy will never stop trying. And I will never stop crying.

With a father who’s an alcoholic addict and a mother whom I get to see only thirty minutes a day, there was no a thing called happiness in my life. It is late to think about dignity and status, when your father has already tried to suffocate your only brother and the whole world knew it. But my mom did think. And I’m not surprised.

I remember…..

My brother, Anthony’s was lying on death bed, and I was sitting in my room, crying. And my parents were arguing with each other. Things couldn’t get worse. But it did.

With a mother in jail, father in hell, and brother in heaven, my life has no meaning.

With this, I hope I’ve explained the reason for committing suicide fully. Please, place this dairy in my coffin. And tell Mummy I love her.
