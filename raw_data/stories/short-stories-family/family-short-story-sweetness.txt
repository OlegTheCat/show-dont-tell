I was very much scared when my sister was in operation theatre for delivery. Three members completes our family . Me my mum and my elder sister. My life begins and ends on them. My sister got married two years before and now she was pregnant . My father passed away when I was 4 . He gave me that much love that will remain until my death. We are two daughters of our parents .They never demanded a boy from god. They have proud on us. My father was not with us but he always made us to feel that he is always with us.

When my sister was in OT the doctor said “something is to worry about we just have to do scissor operation” all family members got tensed and allowed the doctor to do the scissor operation. I never saw my sister sleeping on bed with having no sense at all. I was just being selfish to the unborn baby of my sister. I thought the baby is causing such tension. I  got tears in my eyes. They were just flooding out. I want to be cautious about my sister.

That moment I was only thinking about my sister not the baby. I was in need of the news that my sister is fine and well. My mother and some relatives was with me. The eyes were finding father . He was there with a unseen quality. Suddenly I saw one plastic bag written “i am here” and just I forgot all my tensions.

And doctor came out and said “congress , you got a princess ” Me and my family was very much happy that moment. Doctor gave me that little life. That feeling was awesome , i never felt. She was very much pink and sweet. Me my mother my sister’s husband… all were very much happy. Her sweetness just finished all the worries . I know my father was there with us in that happiness to feel the awesome feeling.
