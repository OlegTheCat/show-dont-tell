Once there was a lady, Gitanjali, who was always merry and gay. She liked to dance and sing. Like mother was her cute daughter, Geetu. They both danced, sang, painted, cooked together. They were very good friends.

In their town there was an announcement. A dance competition for mother-daughter pair was to be held. Gitanjali was very excited about this.

That day when Geetu returned from school, Gitanjali asked her whether she would like to participate in the competition with her. Geetu as usual was busy with her pet parrot, and in her business with the parrot she uttered “hmm”, to which Gitanjali took as her agreement.

As they danced every day, they started dancing to a song. Both of them enjoyed  a lot. Days passed and they practiced. Now was the time for dress rehearsal. Gitanjali took the dress to be worn for the competition. A question jumped in from Geetu, “what are these beautiful dresses for Mom?” Gitanjali was surprised to hear this.

“Darling I had asked you a few days ago, whether you would like to participate in the dance competition,” and you said, “hmm”. 

“But Mom, I don’t remember any such conversation”, said Geetu. “What now can we do, we have registered there and practiced also, let’s do it, come on baby let’s try” said Gitanjali. 

“Ok mom, let’s do it”, said Geetu.

It was the day of the competition. Both Gitanjali and Geetu were a nervous and excited too. They were on the stage to perform, all set to light the stage and astonish the audience. They danced with full zeal and won the competition. 

They returned and laughed at the incident. “Mom, though it was a misunderstanding, it made us so happy and proud of our dance”.
