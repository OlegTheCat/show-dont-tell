Short Story Father’s Love – Lost and Found

 from 

A father. A father who had lost his three year-old son on his first visit to the fair. And then his wife had left him for another man. Life was so extraordinarily cruel for some. He had wept for days, hours at an end exhausting his energy, with the faint ray of hope that he would get his son back. He had roamed for hours on the street, asking strangers for the whereabouts about his boy, showing the photo which he held every night to his breast and sobbed, tears rolling down his eyes. Finally, as a last measure, he took the help of social media. “Any information regarding my son will be helpful.” Power of Facebook, spread the message.

The phone rang.

“Hello.”

 “Hi.”

 “I read the message on Facebook.”

 “Yes! So my son is with you, sir? He must be fifteen now!” said the excited father who felt exactly the same as he had felt when he had first held those tiny little hands and feet for the first time, in his arms, at the hospital. Tears streaked the father’s cheeks. Tears of profound happiness.

“I’m sorry.”

 “I’m sorry what?” the father couldn’t help but shout.

 “My wife and I had adopted your son. A month back we lost him in a road accident.”

Two fathers, one biological, one adoptive, now united with the pain of losing their child. While one lost him once, the other lost him twice. For forever, both.

Sadly, the tears changed. Once it had been for the utmost happiness one can think of. Now, it was of the utmost sadness that there ever was. Grief has many colors. This sadness was profound, excruciating and intolerable.

Meanwhile, in a nearby hospital, a husband became a father. Blessed with a child. A small, tiny, baby boy.
