That was few days after my sister’s marriage, I was back from the school. Even though it was a big day I somehow managed it. And it was real calm in my home and realized that my beloved enemy is away from my home. And I want to write down to my sister that how I was feeling right now.

Dear Sis,

 I’m having fun in the home, Home seems to be good without you devil. From now on I can have all the chocolates and ice-creams. I’m not satisfied even though am having all the paranthas in the home. I don’t know whom to fight for the first parantha in the home. Cracking all the X-box games, but something is missing sorta, that’s you, idiot. I have no back strength without you. There’s nobody to argue with me now, actually, I should be happy at this point of time.

But don’t know why I feel all alone. I don’t know why my tears spread all over my cheeks while writing this to you. You were everything to me, but today without you am nothing idiot. Every little work which you used to do is done by me now. I know how much you suffered these many days with the household chores. Now I have taken the responsibility and I love you more now.

Don’t know what to do with your share of Oreos. Now I have no one to rescue me from mom’s punishments. I have no back strength. Sista I was never fair with you. Even though you loved me, maybe that’s my definition of a sister. I use to think you are the villain in the home but realized you are the only hero of my life. I need a big hug from my sister. Why did you leave me, idiot? And sorta, I know you love me, but you don’t know I love you more.

Bye

And I woke up in the morning and as I was getting ready for the school, I saw this letter and a smile appeared on my face. I wish I could send this to my sister. Because I have none.
