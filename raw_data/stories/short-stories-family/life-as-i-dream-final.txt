I was sitting in office, looking for the housing loan details. I have seen a place, liked it and paid some advance.I came back to Chennai three months before and moved to a PG. Though my parents were resistant first, they got used to it . Now I’m ready to make my own home & live on my own. I was making progress…slowly. I started doing things that I have never dreamt of doing. I go for treks regularly with trekking club in my office.. I started learning a new language… I started learning fashion jewellery.. In short I’m busy.. occupied.. positive and stronger.

I heard Ravi’s voice in a distance. I raised my head and saw him talking to someone. He opened up a lot after that episode. Couple of years back, he has stopped his marriage because he found himself incompatible with the girl. He has fallen out of his family who hated his decision. From the day, I was crying to his shoulders, he mentored me. He helped me move on. He taught me to think in new perspective. He pointed out where should I improve and guided me in right direction. I don’t get to speak with him nowadays. It was different a foreign country, as we were living in the same house. He came back just a month before and now as he is my manager it won’t be appropriate if I spent time with him. But I miss him a lot..miss those conversations with him. Probably when I get released from the project…but I do like this project & do not want too many changes at the same time.

I saw a mail in my mailbox. It is from Ravi addressed to the whole team… and it says He is moving out of project soon.

“Hello” said Ravi. Coming near to my desk

“You are moving out?”

“Yeah. I don’t have much to-do in this project. So I thought……”

“Mm..”

“Hey looking for a loan is it?” he asked me, pointing my desktop.

“Yes. Purchasing a house…”

“Good. Someone knows what they are going to do next…” he teased me.

“Yeah I know …”

“So..?”

” There’s a new restaurant opened nearby , will you come for dinner with me?” I asked him gathering courage, as he will no longer be my reporting manager. This is the first time I’m asking him or for that matter anybody out. I don’t know whether it’s right or wrong.

“No….”

“It’s okay…”

“Hey don’t you know I can’t stand Vegetarian food. Let’s go to Mainland China instead….”

“How do you like the house?”

I asked my brother, who has come down for housewarming ceremony. I can’t help admiring the house and keep kissing the walls of my new house. People are going to think I have gone mad.

“It’s good. Every inch of it looks like it’s built for you…”

I have invited only my immediate family & close friends. I have also invited Ravi…

“Come and boil the milk” ordered my mom. In our region it’s a practise to boil milk on the day of house-warming. It marks the good start for the future.

I kept milk in the stove. I saw Ravi playing with Ragavi’s son, Tarun & I smiled to myself.

I don’t know what’s going to happen between us. I went out quite a few times with him and I like him a lot. But I want to take time before committing myself again.

I don’t know why it didn’t work out with Vineeth. Probably love alone is not sufficient for a happy marriage. May be that’s not meant to be. But I have made peace with the past. I have moved on & accepted that few things just happen to make you stronger. Whatever happened has made me appreciate things I have. I have a lovely family, friends to support me & pull me up whenever required. I still do get hit by a wave of emotions when I see a happy couple, but I have understood happiness is my responsibility. One day I will meet my man, fall in love, be married happily. Till then I will just live and enjoy every moment of this life.

Milk boiled to everyone’s happiness. This is the day of my dream & this is the life of my dream.
