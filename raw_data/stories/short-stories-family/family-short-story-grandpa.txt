“Arun, Always remember what Krishna said to Arjuna –

 ‘If you want to see the brave, look at those who can forgive’.

 So, try to be brave and forgive many people in your life – Grandpa advised Arun after the Aarti at temple. Little Arun couldn’t quite understand why Grandpa said that.

But he always liked to be with his grandpa; especially when they went out in the evenings. His little stories inspired Arun ; he always wondered how grandpa made so many friends – some old, some young.

 Grandpa always had a nod and smile for all who came their way.

“Grandpa, Why does papa never tell stories like you?. Mama says Papa is a busy man” – Arun held grandpa’s hand tightly with one hand and licked the melting cone in the other .

“Son, your papa and mama are working hard to get a better life for you. But remember, when you become big, always find a little time daily for your loved ones “- Grandpa stroked Arun’s hair gently.

Suddenly, Arun woke up from his mid-day nap – He could see his mama sitting alone immersed in her thoughts.

“Mama, i dreamt of grandpa ! He was reading the newspaper on his creaking chair . Afterwards , we went to the Krishna Temple ; While returning home , he bought me a vanilla cone. We walked past Nehru Park , reached home and suddenly he walked away leaving me alone at our doorstep. ” – Little Arun spoke in an excited voice.

“Arun, grandpa will always be with you. Remember him in your prays daily”. She said, holding back tears from him.

‘Zindagi ke Saath bhi, zindagi ke baad bhi’- read the LIC ad in newspaper lying folded on grandpa’s chair..
