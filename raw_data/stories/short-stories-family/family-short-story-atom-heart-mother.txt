“Mumma, i need a bat!!”, li’l Arun remarked. Arun was a class 8 student for whom playing was the heart of life. A great fan of Sachin Tendulkar, trying to copy his shot styles and a motive in his mind to become a great cricketer too. His mother had registered him with a cricket camp in his locality. ” Mumma, i really need a bat!”, Arun cried out.

“Stop screaming Arun, I have a hell lotta work to do”, his mother exclaimed.

The whole town knew about his dad, and how he was shot down by the enemy cavalry from point blank range. People respected him a lot and thus they thought of putting a friendly match between the local teams in his honour.

“Arun, why would you need a bat? It’s been just a month since you got a new bat on your birthday!”, his mom recalled.

“But ma, I need a new bat because the old one has started withering”, Arun pleaded.

“Listen Arun, we are not that high-class family anymore and its tough for me to earn a day’s wage.”, his mother replied.

Arun was perplexed because the match was knocking at the door and the most important thing was that Sachin was coming as a Guest of Honor to watch the match. Everybody in the area was cheerful, happy and were waiting for the day to come. Arun, on the other hand was morosed, closed the door with a bang and went out to the field.

“Papa, i need a new bat !”,Arun tearingly recalled within himself. His daddy was an important person in Arun’s life. Anything that Arun wanted as a kid had always been fulfilled by his dad. He was a HERO and the GENIE in his son’s life.
