Walk discreetly, like someone’s closely watching you. Be watchful about your veil, it should cover every bit of the skin you dare to reveal. Care more about what others say, less about your thoughts that you want to share. In fact, you are not to hold opinions, believe what is said, follow, not lead, the instructions given you must heed. Yes. You are given a little space, the space between the kitchen and the veranda of the dining hall. We love you, and that is why you must be the way the rules are prescribed by “us”. “Us,” the individuals who know what is best for you, what your fate holds. “Us”, the people who gave you life, who know for a fact that there can be no better judges, no better deciders for the betterment, for the bright future you hold.

 

Think before you talk Radha, they are people with strict traditional values, so says father. You do have education, I haven’t deprived you of that. Wait. Is it education that is making you behave the way you do? Why are you eager to bring this family humiliation? Ram, the same blood as you, understands better. You better be well behaved or the consequences will be worse.

 

You are eighteen. I was only fifteen, when your father was smitten by my beauty and culinary skills. You may not be the best in either, but you are average in both and you have taught yourself to read and write. Look beyond the book though my dear daughter, the books that encase your life might be the fall of your rest of the life that you have to share with the man you should here onwards rely on. Parents are only with you till they have to be.

 

 

My friends say, my mom is so cool. What I say is, 

, we have are going to have a long relationship…after all as my mother says, writing is the only source to vent out the pent up emotions!
