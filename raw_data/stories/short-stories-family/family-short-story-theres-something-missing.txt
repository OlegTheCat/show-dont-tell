Short Story Family – There’s Something Missing

One day as I was walking down a cold, deserted road, I realized that there was something missing from my life. Unsure of what it was, I walked a little further, past my house, past my school, until eventually I came to a pond. I sat there, on the grass, for who knows how long. I was starting to doze off and awoke to a startled cry.

I opened my eyes and peered through the haze of sleep at the child before me. She couldn’t have been more than five years old, with short blonde hair and a blue summer dress. Her blue eyes were wide and filled with tears. I was about to run to her when suddenly she bolted, ran down the street as fast as she could, only pausing to look back at me with a pleading expression. Confused, I ran after her down the road.

By the time I caught her, the sun was setting and I realized I should be heading home. I didn’t, though; I was too worried about what might happen to this poor little girl. I crouched down in front of her, extended my hand as one would approach a wild animal. She hesitated.  A small smile formed on her lips and then, without warning, she ran into my arms. She smelled of cinnamon and her hair tickled my nose. “I’m Anne”, I whispered in her ear. “Who are you?” I could hear her breathing, soft and shallow. She whispered back “Lily. I’m Lily.”

About a month later, Lily was living with me. It turns out her parents were unfit. They abused her and so she ran away from home. But I thank her parents, I thank them for helping me find what was missing in my life: someone to take care of, someone who needed me as desperately as I needed them.
