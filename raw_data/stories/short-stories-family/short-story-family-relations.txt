There was a boy named Arun, who stayed at a small home in a village. In his house, all females used to shout on man, miss behaved with them, they forced their husbands to do all type of house works. He had seen his mother asking his father to do mopping, washing utensils and also cooking food. When ever he prepared food, mother never said the food is good. Always use to come out with mistakes in food.

When Arun went to school, there he had learnt that a girl should be respected and in the same way, boy. But at his home, it was other way. The males of the family did all the household work. They went to market for purchasing vegetables, fruits, groceries and all. Then after coming from market, they did work. Since 30 years of age, Arun has observed same thing at his chacha’s house and his bother’s house.

One day, he got married with a innocent girl named Surili. She belongs to a very well-to-do and well behaved family, He started behaving bad way from 10th day of marriage. Though the girl was down to earth, still Arun used to shout and was annoyed with her. And thus family was always unhappy and in tense atmosphere. No happiness was seen in family.

One day, when Surili was working at home, she got hurt by knife in kitchen. She could not do any household work. Arun got very annoyed and angry. Then Arun’s father came to see them. Surili cooked good food for her father in-law. Arun’s Father was very happy and satisfied by her service and care. He explained Arun about the girl, that Surili is very good by nature and please do not harass her as we are getting troubled by your mother.

Then when Arun realized that and saw a smile on his father’s face. He said sorry to Surili and then they both stayed very happily.
