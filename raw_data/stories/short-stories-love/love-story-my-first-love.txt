Love Short Story – My First Love

My day started with emptiness, I woke up with a joy of seeing her, and then my brain said that I can’t see her today. New place with people I am meeting for the first time. She is my love, my life and everything for me. She lives with my thought, without me she can’t imagine her life, so do I.

She promised me to meet me in the weekends. I don’t know how I am going to manage this complete week without seeing her.  My day will not end without sharing the events of the day with her and the kiss which she gives when we depart. I got new companionship, managed to finish my first day with tears which my pillow only knows.

I don’t know when I slept, the second day without her, interesting things happening around me, everyone were happy sharing their thoughts, introducing self to others. But nothing seemed interesting for me. I am in a different world with the memories of her. The day finished with tears in my pillow.

Third day: Tears in my pillow

Fourth day: Tears in my pillow

Fifth day: Tears in my pillow

Sixth day: The day came to meet her, started my day early and got ready with complete enthusiasm. With the best dress I have. Skipped my breakfast, she came. I ran towards her, hugged her. She saw the tears which my pillow only knows. My eyes spoke with her, my mouth is shut and my mind is searching for words to tell how much I love her. The words I spoke with her “

”.
