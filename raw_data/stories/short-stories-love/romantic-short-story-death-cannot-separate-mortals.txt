Beauty is not abt perception,not about make up.beauty is all about knowing and liking some one and oneself.Memory… is the diary that we all carry about with us.memories itself is an internal rumour but this rumour turned true in my life….still now the face of that beautiful girl creates a turbulence in me….still flashing in my mind…The first time i saw her during jagadhatri puja,it was a love at first sight.she passed by me dressed in pink and black with her hair open and her eyes shimmering and dazzling with happiness…she was wid her father….i stopped for a moment and my eyes refused to miss a glimpse of her….she walked away stealing my heart ……forever!

 disappeared ….i never met her again….

 

 sometimes i caught a sight of her but in a moment of hurry….she is my “dream girl”…and forever disappeared because i came to hyderabad leaving her and her memories behind…..

 

FACEBOOK creates miracles…and the miracualous part was that i got my dream girl after four long years….meanwhile many things changed in my life but my love remained the same…

 

“hello”,”wats ur name”,…conversation started….continued..for ten days again i missed her words and the interesting conversation as she left for south india wid her family…..

 

on 11 th october, i finally confessed my feelings for her.. i was nervous ,many things troubled my mind…but gained courage .The word “techanically ” made her laughed…we exchanged our cell numbers….AFTER A LONG WAIT FOR 4 YEARS , I HEARD HER VOICE….”HELLO”….GOD !she is so sweet …..after a chat over the phone she even disclosed her likings..”i love u ” the magic was intoxicating ….it created a spell……

so curious! whats next???

she is my beloved and my lovely wife …as i pen down my feelings she sits beside me (inside my heart)and enjoys our love story with a mesmerising smile on her face……..i love her .!
