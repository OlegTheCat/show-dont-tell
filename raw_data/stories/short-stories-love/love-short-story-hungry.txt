Flows of the air on a narrow river between the shiny dry sand, Durjaẏ Kumar put his leg into the water and felt the cold thrill on his body .

The wide breast river is in village of Durjay, may ooze slime layer. There, the near of Himalayas is small stones and sand. Feet from the floor of the murmur is not a knee-deep water. Like a eighteen year-old girl. Village river of Durjoy is The mother Ganges . She is thick & adult. Away a goat is being dam by a black daughter. Durjay do try to know the name of the river. He do shout.

– What is the name called of the river ?

Goat is tied, the daughter do see like a fool to the Durjay .

The handsome man has shout again .

– What is the name?

The girl said;

– Who ?……. I ?……. Goat?

– The river name ?

_ Hungry…. are you people of opera drama ?

With the same force the girl asked the question .

Durjay do bass voice in opera style.

Then ; the publicity mike on a van have gone towards the village .

 …..Opera ….Opera ….Opera ……. kolkata’s famous opera party Manjusri opera is presenting her best drama of this year ” A game with love ”

Durjay’s bedding comes on house of Nooruddin ; He is the main organizer of the program . Nooruddin has want The heroine will be share his house . Team manager said ; she is come up by private car & stay in the hotel . She do not use ground fault for Toilet .

A wonder is reflected on the face of Nooruddin by open red teeth . He is satisfied for getting a chance to hospitality of the heroine alternative the hero.

A servant boy entered into the room before with beading . Durjay kumar is behind the boy . He have Wear tight panjabi , his hair is swept . A girl is looking from poor wicker Cooking chamber towards the bed room , Durjay have seen him at fast in the morning near to the river . But she is looking very shy now . By contact with Durjay eyes the girl has taken her large veil in the head.

NoorUddin done order to the daughter .

– would serve double egg omelet & tea for the Master .

The indoor and outside of the house is very Clean & Clean .The Bedding manager has gone by setting the bed of Durjay .

-If you feel need anything , please tell me . I Will be sit with the decorator for the stage making .

Nooruddin goes out by presenting the cheek of modesty .

Crossing the yard & doorway ; Nurjahan arrived into the room With a cup & plate . Durjay was changing his dress . Nurajahan knocked stand back on the door .Durjay looked still the girl in the hesitation . Durjay have silent , Nurjahan did control her Laugh by pressed hands on the face & turned towards the Durjay .

From the veil Nurajahan says ;

– Your breakfast .

Durjay did feeling hungry for throughout the night away way journey . Durjay quickly takes the plate & cup . He puts over half omelet into the mouth & also takes a sip of tea . Nurjahan did laugh again behind the veil .By hearing the laugh of Nurjahan , Durjay looked him & tried to smile.

Durjay thinks that ; he has practiced selfishness and immorality only into the ten years of the life of the opera career . After failure of secondary education Durjay was came from the village in Kolkata at Citpur opera industry with a capital of good Hindi Bengali movie singer . After few years the landless farmers boy Haronath has become hero the Durjay Kumar into the Color full poster of Chitpur . The colors of the poster have done the life exaggerated . He is addicted to alcohol .

Durjay opened petticoat string of the many actress of goody or colleen for work with an eye to next year . so many time the team owner did backing him to entertainment for cash in hand . The first was the self-glorification . still have?Actually the life is full in two colors of a black and a white .The black cannot analysis ,When the white transparency is reflected into the life the black tint are looks . Self sting do fight against the brain & soul .

In childhood he never could not think that he will be a hero of opera . But Durjay attendance was inevitable like the other ten people in the news of opera theater presentation . What is the demand in life ? Nobody cannot understand . By the crowd of the diversity every turning of the life do inspired to overcome the next crossing.

Life go away , but never go back . Availability , unavailability ; appease & the discontent ; everything is become mysterious for the life ; to provides provisions of worth living . Somehow what is the life without eating , Sleeping and purge . Sometimes the body do searched another body naked from the beautiful dress like a coffin for enjoyment . On the bodies pieces of meat do lick & we is melt down instantly .The food is never selected in appetite . At the end soul can understand that what we have eaten .The unfulfilled makes feeling more amuse . we will be stay only for the Soul strain.The rule of the Soul is dress of the naked heart . This is like conscience character of opera drama . However; it is not to be seen . But can still realise attendance .

Slip of heart is not all thing of life . In life slip is smaller than skip .Durjay says with the last sip of tea ;

– Your,s Abba ( father ) taken care of every lack with respect from coming the village .

The girl laughed loud .

Durjay felt resentful ; becouse he has not understand cause of the laughing .

– why you are laughing unnecessary ?

With bit her lips by teeth the girl said .

– In joke will be not laugh .

Durjay said with wonder ;

– What I have told about the laugh ?

confusion did coruscation on the face of this girl .

– Are you not told he is my Abba ( Father)?

Durjay said again with his wonder .

– Am I wrong ?

Nurjahan said;

_ Yes ; he is my Mia ( husband ) .

Suddenly lightning did flash on the sky without a cloud .Without seeing anything in perspective of rain ; Nurjahan left the room for save the goat into the field . Durjay kumar did close his acquired brisk sentences of the two lips automatically .

After few time the rain came down with full face. Also come premature darkness in the morning . Durjay did thinking a funnel would be good . wearing wringing clothes With a oil lamp Nurjahan came front to oil lamp stand on the wall .The fire burned also the lamp on the wall & the heart of Durjay .The wet sexy figure of Nurjahan,s is seen bright on the gray light of the funnel lamp. By burning of the heart of Durjay the black lady became so beautiful . When the veil removed Nurjahan did not understand . To keep up the funnel on the wall stand Nurjahan looked on eyes of Durjay . Nurjahan do laugh with close the lips for seeing herself by Durjay . Durjay say;

– You did completely dank .

Nurjahan covered her body by the towel ; she did clean her mouth by the outside corner of the towel.The breasts of Nurjahan were playing into the towel hidden like tow pigeon . Nurjahan said ;

 Palan said that without pay you have done f**k your goat ; will be call meeting in Panchayat against yours Mia. if he would not like to pay hundred rupees.
