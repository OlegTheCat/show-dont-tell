An Article – ARE YOU IN LOVE???

‘A software engineer killed himself in his car’ the story behind his suicide was he used to flirt with a girl without seeing her, after certain days he requested for her photo n when he found her beautiful in the photo, he proposed her the very next day and when she replied she is already engaged, the heartbroken engineer killed himself in his car in an unusal way leaving her a death note in which he wished her all the best for her future…

Before continuing just think about this story and what is your impression about the guy?, ‘a fool’, ‘a mad lover’, or ‘a true lover’, okay let me tell you the other side of the story, after his death when police investigated they found the girl and they found the girl not the same in the photo, and the girl was actually ugly and neither she was in love nor she was engaged, when asked she told she did it just for time pass.

Okay now do you think the girl was a culprit(passive murderer) and the guy a victim? and let me guess now you kind of have sympathy towards the guy and anger towards the girl, don’t you???

Now let me share my view on this entire concept ‘LOVE’: How do you feel when you are buying something new, very much excited no?, and that excitation grows till you buy it and how many days you can carry on the same excitation?, a day, a week or maximum a month, then your feeling towards it changes, you will not be having further excitation, and what feeling you have towards it now is the true one and permanent one, the same things happens in case of ‘LOVE’, I don’t think you need further comparison, in the above story the same thing happened actually there was no love in the story, he started to feel for her when he found her beautiful, and do you think he was in love when he made hundreds of people who loved him to cry?

Actually the story is very common but only little bit extreme, here are my lines about love “love is like a brand, a good  brand name used to produce cheap products, People like those cheap products but they are ashamed to buy them, so they want a brand name, that is ‘Love’”

Before blaming the girl question yourself don’t you flirt with someone for time pass?, before blaming the boy question yourself haven’t you thought of sacrificing everything else for a girl/boy most of the time when she/he is attractive, and if you are committed to someone question yourself…

 are you in love? LOVE???
