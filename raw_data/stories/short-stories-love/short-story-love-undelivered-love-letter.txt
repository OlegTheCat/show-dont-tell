“ Deepa”, “I have been looking for you my child, what are you doing?” Hariram entered the room with a glass of milk.

“I’ll drink it Hariram, can you please leave this here.”

As Hariram began to leave the room, Deepa ;

“Whose diary is this? I found it on the table here.”

“Oh, this Mr. Udit Agarwal’s diary, the gentleman who had taken the guesthouse for lease last week, for whom you had bought the cake. I am sorry I left it here; I actually had to pack it up. I had called him up, reminding him to take his diary. I’ll courier it to him today.”

“This letter was written for me Udit, why was it not given to me?”

Deepa, sat on the bed, crying, staring at the diary.

“ What happened my child? What is bothering you? Why are you crying?”

“ Baba, I was reading the love letter Udit has written. He has written it for a girl whom he didn’t realize was me.”

Deepa, took out the Happy Birthday message she had written for Udit from his diary that was kept as a book mark.

“But why are you crying? Are you sure this guy loves you? You have gone through a lot of trouble in your life. You need to be sure what you are thinking?”

“Baba, I have read the entire letter and his diary note. I have spent my entire life searching for love. But I have never been successful. And I have always learnt that all my relationships have been murdered by ego, attitude and ignorance. I have finally found someone who loves me and wants me in his life, and this itself is a gift in itself. I am thankful to God that true love has found me.”

Hariram wiping his tears; “Today if your father was alive, he would have been the happiest man in the world.

Here, take his number.”

 

Deepa dials the number,….

“Hello,”….

After a long pause.. “Udit?”

“Yes, this is Udit Agarwal”…

“Hi,………

this the girl in red shorts, white top whom you met at the Calangute beach”……..
