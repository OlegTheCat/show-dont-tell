Life Of A Heart Breaker - Love Short Story

THE STORY OF A PLAYER (PLAY BOY)

He has been in a relationship with this lady for a long time about (1 and a half years) . His love for this lady grew like a class being filled with water . This all happened when he was twenty years of age and as fresh as an Apple on the tree.

 He loved this lady with all his heart , soul , time and body.

He had the shock of his life when he finally made his feelings known to this lady and only to relies that this lady only took him for a ride but with God who is the Father of all creations, took this guy’s heart and gave it rest, peace, happiness and everything in life.

A lesson he learn t in life was that women are very mysterious creatures who can never be understood .

He did whatever the lady asked out of pure love and affection.

Due to his broken heart , he decided to be player as a form of revenge, because his broken heart is like glass(heart) which was filled with water(love and affection) which has been thrown on a hard surface to shatter.

His revenge was deadly, He started breaking the heart of women, making them weep , cry in pain .

To the men it’s a joyful news but, to the women, it’s not right. The women!!! why is it not right? You should know that not all men are the same and also some men are highly emotional. She should have told the guy a very long time ago before breaking his heart .

His end was not good at all. He ended up with an outrageous, impassionate, uncaring lady.

My advice to you all guys, is, if you have a good, caring , loving lady hold her well , treat her like a Queen and if you have been broken heart don’t worry she does not deserve you in any way. Keep your head high the rightful lady is on her way coming . And for the ladies the same goes to you.

NEVER, EVER,EVER FALL IN LOVE WITH THE WRONG PERSON.
