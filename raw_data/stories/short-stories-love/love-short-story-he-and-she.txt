We couldn’t find any reason to continue  our relationship. and so a break up is the best among the options. Its all because her. We went loving and now breaking up. All because of just her. Its she who proposed me. SHE.. not ME..  Its she who kissed me first.. I still remember…its her.. its the same she who added ego into our love recipe .. its the same she who hurts me the most.. Its the same she who I hate now….

He never ever understood me. My neighbor, my lover..,. Why should I keep an idiot who cant understand me ? .. He was always angry on me…  He always made me cry.. Why should I bear him.. He made me go and propose him. That idiot didn’t have guts for even an “I love you”.. I know I know… He want to kiss me… But he is so much of a coward and not even will think of doing that so I did it first…

Now…. I am the happiest man on the earth. I thought its going to hurt me.But,, She is out of my cast within hours. I could smile well now. I could talk with my sis , bro freely without thinking of her.  This is what I call life. This should be done before… I don’t need her

I don’t know how he feels. Its true that I am in bit of a pain. I feel like I lost a part of my life. Now I couldn’t find a good breath. Ya. Its true. I am missing him…………..

Phone in hand… waiting for a text or a call…. here comes a tear out of my right eye. He always use tell me about my eyes. He like my eyes. Mine are blue. He is the only one who liked those. He is the reason I like those now. He is so mean. Cant he text me ? I know that it is hurting him….Still he is not…..  Each breath taken makes a pain in my heart.. Please .. Please text me… Please I beg you…  I really don’t like this… I am waiting… For his text….. saying sorry……..

This is good. I never thought I am this much strong… Yahooooo!…..  But…. Why did I am reading her old texts now ?.. hey.. why the hell am I looking her dirty useless photo.. you know what… she looks dirty.. ya..,true.. but still……………….a bit  awesome….

WOW! I still remember that smile of her when I said that she is the cutest girl on earth…  I still remember how she cried when I got that nasty bike accident…. I still remember that very first day of my +2 when she yelled out my name knowing we are on the same class…. I still remember……………………………………..

She was an angel… you know….. an angel……. she……. I got angry on her a lot… Just on an assurance that she will never leave me…. Her eyes ! OMG! my angel’s eyes… I miss those… How can I sleep without her “good night” ?… How can I live without taking to her… This is when i am searching for the reason of our break up.. I don’t know…  My pillow is getting wet… I am just thinking of her….

She used to call me at nights and say “GH”.. you know that’s a secret.. you will never know that…. What should I do now ?……I  want to hug my angel so tight…..

It was just me!.. Now I am sure.. It was just me….  Who was sincere…

Now what ? Been thinking that for quite a long while and decided to……. Decided to forget him.. That useless……

Switched off my phone.. No mercy… A mirror looking.. last drop of tear… a smile… “you are well set” i said to myself….. I am now thinking about 

 my favorite movie… It could make me forget about him.. What a movie it is ..na ? So novel .. poetic… those love scenes always made me think of him…. OOOPS….. him… again…. okk… its fine,.. gone…. ok… where were we ?.. ya VTV,,, quite fantastic…………………. Still…… Why did he left me ?… He always used to said he will not…….

I want her now… I need her.. I have to hug her and say a million sorry. I really love her… Ya.. i am going to call he…. call or text …. call… It will be good…. Dialing 9567251….. oh what what the last three numbers… ?? here is it……..oh…  my hands are shivering….. I need to do this… I need to…..ok done …………

Oh! crap … Switched off… what happened to her ?  Did she……. no… never…. Battery down…. Nothing else…I am sure,… Oh…  For what hell of a reason I… I love her… I love my angel…. YA!… Thats the way… I need to go there…. she is my neighbor na ?… I went out… Without making any one knowing… Slowly .. through the back door…  Ran to her house… There she is … She is crying… She saw me…. I think she don’t want me here…. She is just…. embarrassing look…..

I think i loved him more than I thought… My tears showed that.. The veranda of my house… This is where I started dreaming of him… This place made me love him.. Tears are flowing out from my blue eyes… Like a very odd love story… A tiny bit and………………………………………..

Hey! its him…. Why is he here now…. No… I will not talk to him… If I cant bear this… I don’t think its good to build it more and have a break up again… He is such a crap… He will break this up again…. What ever he do.. I will not… Its decided… If he touches me … I will slap him and call out loud………

.Will he say sorry ?……… please……. oh God……..NO!!!!!

She had fire in her eyes … She dont love me…. My heart is really blasting… She dont need me… Better leave…. I took a very step back..I started walking back. endless tears…. I am weeping too much… All those memories… Moments with her… went flashing through my mind….  Those smiles, those fights….

Suddenly… So suddenly…. there was a wind…. I ran back…. hugged her… all of a sudden.. she was smiling… with tears….

I dont know what happened…. He ran and hugged me and…… i dont know….I think I love him………………

 

“WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ?”

“PAPA.. I LOVE HIM….”
