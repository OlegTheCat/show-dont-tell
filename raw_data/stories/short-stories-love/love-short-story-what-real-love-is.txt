Love Short Story – What real love is?

 from 

Year  2008 , I  met a guy online through internet . I  was so happy and was thinking he could be my soul mate. We chat always , he is calling me everyday and every night. He said he will come here in Philippines by September and marry me. I was so in love with him even we didn’t met each other in person.

After a year of full of  love promises , I noticed changes on his attitude. One day, I did not receive a call and text , I  was so worried thinking that there is maybe something bad happen to my James, my bf. I checked my email, i was so glad that I received email from my him. It is just short letter just letting me know he change his mind and he do not like to keep in touch with me anymore.

Three weeks  ago he sent me a link of  videos of his family.  I found out he marry a Filipina also and now have pretty daughter and a cute baby boy. I watched some of the videos. Then, I realized I am happy for him. Many words unsaid and reasons untold. I can see he really love his family and he even called his self as a Super dad…But still I  feel the pain . He broke my heart but why is it i feel happy for him????

I understand that  all things in this world have reasons. After he sent me email my heart feel much better. I am not living  anymore with hope that he will come back to me. I can move on and learn to love the person loving me now.. James  may not the right guy for me but he is the right guy for another lovely woman. I pray to God James that you will be safe always and more blessings for your family.  James and Michelle love story now is closed..
