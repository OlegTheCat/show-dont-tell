Oh! It was such a dreadful and horrible night! Even the stars had stopped blinking as if, they were too terrified to note down the inevitable fate! Martha knew, the end was creeping down the lane, knocking on the door, whispering in hushed tones!

Kenny was coughing and succumbing horrifically than usual. Martha’s attention though, didn’t fall even once, upon the poor soul! She was simply lost in her sedentary position near the broken glass panes of the enigmatic Victorian stylized window. She was waiting for the eclipse; when the shadow of the earth will completely engulf its sole natural satellite, moon!

Even the moron and mundane sky was aware of her unscripted story; Martha sensed. It had hence, draped itself in profuse black cloak like a widow! She reminisced about the last eclipse she and Kenny had enjoyed together. When the moon timidly faded away in eternity, Kenny kissed his beautiful wife and muttered, “Hold my hand Martha! Till death do us part!”

Martha blushed in bewilderment. ” Why death? Aren’t we supposed to live together throughout?”

Kenny curled Martha’s brown hair lock in appreciation! “So true! Death is nothing but the mere decaying of the body; How can it detach our love blossomed souls?”

Kenny coughed heavily; he tried to envision his prolonged human life one last time, but in vain. Just before the same, his last breadth had collapsed in desperation.

It was just in time with the full moon eclipse. Martha stood up and hugged her beloved. Their spirits collaborated after twenty long years of Martha’s demise and slowly melted away in darkness!

The only life-sized canvas in the room showcasing the happy old days of the duo was lost; never to be found again, even in the umbral contour of the earth that swallows the moon !
