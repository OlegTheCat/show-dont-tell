Romantic Short Story – A kiss along the rain

“I can never be 22 again”, she said to the mirror. A new wrinkle at the corner of her eye added strength to the fact that she was ageing.

Anne was in her favorite white sleeveless shirt and lilac garden skirt that overflown upto her knees. Grabbing her hat from the curtain pole she stole a glance through the window. David was by the fence with his eyes stuck on the waves. No matter how busy and tired he was, Sunday evening was reserved for some time at the beach.’Though he cannot be the same David again’,she thought to herself. She couldn’t remember the last time when his lips were on hers.

David was in his worn-out jeans and grey T-shirt that made him look more older than he was. Sensing the footsteps behind, he moved forward. She felt a bit disappointment but faking a smile she struggled to keep up to his pace.

 Every time his hand brushed against her own she felt a sudden impulse which failed to produce goose-bumps;because she knew they were getting older and romance had bid good-bye to him(but not to her).

“Lets not go too far”, said he looking away from her. She talked to him continuously to which he replied in ‘Ahs’ and ‘Hmms’.

It was early June but the rain hadn’t made its entry.

Wiping the sweat pearls on her forehead she gave up talking as she knew she was making him bored. She moved towards the ocean.

Suddenly David took a step ahead of her and stared in her eyes. His hands interlocked around her waist and pulled her towards him.

The breeze threw her hat off and her hair danced to the inaudible music. She shuddered and David tightened his grip.

 He traced her cheek bone and removed a strand of hair from her face. “You are beautiful”, he whispered in her ears. Anne could find herself on toes and her lips shivered.

He leaned in to kiss her and it was raining heavily.
