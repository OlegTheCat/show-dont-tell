Love Short Story – The girl I missed is the one I loved most

It might be the beginning of my college days. After completion of my +2 degree, entrance exams, seat allotment everything goes in hurry. But finally my college started late in the month of October.

My 1st year, two feelings arise at every moment one feeling with fear and the other I am doing engineering. Every morning the same routine classes make me feel sad, because might be we are under the limelight of hard feeling that we are doing engineering, unable to sit quiet in single class, because we never bother about listening, but we bother much about the girls, who is pretty smart, cute and who smiles for everything we do it might be silly or reason less.

At that moment I thought God is great , because many love stories will come to life, and ready to do many nasty things for the sake of their love, yeah, i am the one who has fallen in that love trap. Still I went on loving that single girl, who never said a HIE in any of the social site like Facebook and watsup, but it is very easy to count in the whole of my engineering life I talked with her few times, but the glow in her face attracted me, to watch her everyday.

Many times I want to express but we have few restrictions in our families which stop me from expressing myself to her. But the 4 yrs of my engineering left few fantasies and few unforgettable moments with her, where I started writing love stories, to share with her but till today I never shared one with her.

Before starting my story of love for her, the love what she shows never be forgotten. She is not much hard, but sweet like a gingerbread, talks very less, cares everyone, with sweet chubby cheeks which I remember most, most unforgettable days……
