Romantic Short Story – STAY…

The wind blew her hair. She was driving with the windows rolled down. She liked it that way. She tucked her messy hair behind her ear and took the wheel again. She was planning her next vacation.

She looked sideways at the car beside her. She recognized it rather quickly.

“Vikram! ” She shouted waving her hand at the guy driving the red car.

Vikram turned recognizing the voice. ” Hey!” he called out. He looked happy. But then the expression changed into something else.

Anisha made a gesture saying that she would meet him in Star bucks. Vikram nodded. She speeded away.

Vikram was about eight years older than Anisha. They became friends as they worked in the same building. They found out they had a few common friends too. Things were easy for both of them. They were two strangers who turned friends miles away from their homes. They were both happy and carefree people.  The first coffee they had lasted for three hours, forty five minutes and fifty seconds. Anisha always joked that what are the odds of finding a fellow Indian who speaks the same language as her who thinks exactly like her miles away from home. But ,they both were quite happy they found each other.

Vikram parked in his usual spot and hopped out of the car. Anisha was waiting for him.

” Nice car. ” She said acting like she was checking his car out.

” She is gorgeous, isn’t she? ”  He said laughing. Anisha nodded.

” But do you know who is more gorgeous than that? ” He said walking towards her.

She held a hand saying , ” Don’t even try. Don’t even think.”

Her smirk turned into a huge grin. This was how they greeted each other whenever they met. This was the exact conversation that started their two years long friendship. Anisha still makes fun of Vikram for trying to hit on her the first time.

They high fived and walked into the cafe together. They sat in their usual place ordering the same espresso as always.

” So I was thinking of going away to the Himalayas in November. ” Anisha started.

Vikram laughed. ” You didn’t even join your new job in Italy.  Worse, I don’t think you even packed your bags yet. And you are thinking of the vacay you’d take after six months? Wow idiot. You’ve outdone yourself. ”

” Oh come on. Like you haven’t planned your next destination yet. I am sure you did. Probably that’s why you look all lost these days. And who packs bags two days before anyway? ” She winked.

Vikram was never the one to work in  the same city for more than a year. He hated routine. He hated living in the same place year after year. But since he met Anisha, he didn’t want to be anywhere but New York. She made New York more fun. His Sundays were filled with activity thanks to her.

” Hello… Baba ji. Come back to this world. You are lost again. ” She said clapping her hands.

Vikram laughed. 

Vikram looked down at his old T-shirt and faded jeans. 

Anisha spoke. ” Viki. Are you checking yourself out? Seriously dude? ” She was making an annoyed face.

” No. Just… you know… ” 

” Okay. What is the matter Viki? ” She asked looking concerned.

” Nothing really. I am fine. Tell me about how you are feeling? Can’t wait to leave America huh? ” He asked. 

” I don’t know. Mixed feelings you know. So you sure you’re ok? ” She asked. 

” Yeah. Its nothing.” he smiled.

” Since when do you hide things from me? ” she smiled.

” Look whatever it is, you can tell me. If you lost someone in your family or if anyone is sick. Anything for that matter. I am here. ” She said looking at him. 

” Oh my God Anisha. I am really fine. Everyone is okay. You look so concerned!” He laughed.

” I am concerned. You hardly talk these days. You always space out. You are kinda lost all the time. ” She said sipping her coffee.

Anisha watched Vikram’s face change. ” What is it? Is it a girl? Do you like someone? You want me to give her a conduct certificate of you. Tell me. I can and I will. I will make her crazy about you.” She said. 

” I am pretty sure you are capable of that. Driving people crazy I mean. ” Vikram chuckled. 

” Very funny Vikram. You only have till day after to tell me whats eating you away anyway. I will be GONE after that. ” She said putting her coffee down.

” You are right. There is something that I wanted to talk to you about. ” Vikram spoke hesitantly.

” Finally. He speaks. ” Anisha leans in to listen.

” Go on. ” She prodded smiling.

” I am in love with you Anisha.” He said without a thought.

” What… I mean why? ” she asked. ” I mean why so suddenly?” she continued.

” Its not sudden. I always did. I just couldn’t risk losing you.” He said his eyes meeting her eyes.

Suddenly everything made sense to Anisha. 

” Do you expect an answer from me? ” She asked looking at him. 

Something clicked in Vikram’s head. 

He couldn’t get the words. So he just nodded his head saying no.

” I appreciate you telling me Vikram. And I understand. But lets not talk about this. Shall we?”

” We won’t. ” He said smiling. 

” Cool. Lets get going then. I might as well get packing.” Anisha said getting up. 

Vikram rose and smiled giving her way. 

She pressed her phone close to her ear. ” Please leave a message. ” 

Vikram was lying on the recliner. He was watching the snow. His phone was blinking with Anisha’s name. He looked again at the phone before placing it back on the coffee table. 

She reluctantly walked towards the security check. She turned and looked back once again to see if he had come. 

He walked over to the window. 

She sat in the lobby dialing him one last time before boarding. 

” Please leave a message.” the machine said.

She breathed heavily, ” Hey Viki. This is it man… Um… I … I am leaving. Italy calling! Take good care of New York for me will you? And your car too … Er… Um… Okay then… Good bye.” She cut the call. She could feel tears welling up. 

She burst into tears thinking of all those wonderful times they had.

” Okay then.. Good bye.” the message kept ringing in his ears. 

He could feel the heartbreak in every inch of his body and soul.

She was walking home. Anisha was living her dream. She always wanted to work in Italy. She fell in love with the art, culture and language of the city as a kid. Da Vinci walked these streets. Michelangelo was part of this amazing culture. But, she knew she wasn’t happy. This was her dream job. This was “IT”. Her life was happening NOW. But somehow she felt like she lost a part of her back in New York.

She opened the lock and threw her satchel on the floor. She ran to the phone to check her messages. She had none. She left Vikram a long email with all her contact numbers here in Italy. Just in case he wanted to talk. But he never called.

A tear escaped her eyes. She controlled her emotions and switched on the TV. Family guy was playing. 

She turned it off. Everything reminded her of him. EVERYTHING.

She couldn’t stop it anymore. The deluge of tears followed. Her thoughts went back to him.

There was a knock on the door. 

She walked towards the door after clearing her botched make up quickly. She wiped off the tears and opened the door expecting the good-natured Italian lady.

He was there instead.

” Hey” Anisha beamed. ” Wasn’t expecting you! ” she said casually. 

” Hey Anisha. I know I know. Long story.” he said. 

” Come on in. ” Anisha said showing him in.

” Nice place. ” Vikram said looking around. ” You stay alone? ” 

” Of course Viki. I stay alone. You know me. I like being on my own.” She shrugged. 

” Right. I was just around here. Thought I’d say hi. So I dropped by.”  He said. 

She smiled. ” Coffee?” she asked.

” Yes please.” He smiled settling on the couch. 

She left the living room to get him coffee.

” You need help with that? ” He said walking into the kitchen. 

” I just need to plug in the espresso machine. ” She winked. ” Shouldn’t be much of trouble. ” she laughed.

 ” Hmm.” He said reaching for two mugs.

” You know you never called. I left you a ton of messages. ” She said carefully avoiding his eyes.

He hesitated. 

” I’ve been busy. ” He said looking away.

” Right. I understand.” She said taking the mugs from him.

” So.. Beautiful city huh? ” he said gazing out of the window.

” Yeah. Its awesome. ” she replied. 

They both reached for the coffee pot at the same time. Their fingers touched. They immediately pulled away acting like it didn’t happen.

“Sorry.” Vikram apologized. 

“Sorry.” Anisha also apologized. 

He then poured the coffee into the mug and handed it to her.

” Lets go to the terrace. The sunset is beautiful.” she smiled. 

” Lead the way.” He laughed. 

” So how is life? How is New York?” she inquired pulling her hair back. 

Vikram was just staring before he realized she was asking something.

” I am sorry. You were asking something. This place is so beautiful I wasn’t really paying attention. ” he explained. 

She laughed. ” Don’t apologize so much. You are treating me like a stranger. I just asked how you were doing. All good I hope. ”

” Yes yes. Everything is going great. ” he replied trying to pull his gaze away from her locks. 

” Good to know that. ” She smiled sipping her coffee and looking at the city.

” You’ve been good too I hope? ” he asked .

” Yeah.” she answered too quickly. ” So till when are you staying in Florence?” she continued. 

 ” Somebody is in a rush to kick me out. ” He laughed.

” Yeah yeah. You are such a burden you know. ” she laughed.

” I will leave in sometime. I am staying with my tour group. Will fly back tomorrow.” He said trying to smile.

” Hmm. Maybe I can see you off at the airport? Or maybe you could stay the night? I mean you could sleep in the bed room. I will take the couch. Anything that works.” she said quietly trying not to look at him.

” I really can’t. I have other plans. ” He said abruptly.

“Oh okay. Cool. Its nice of you to visit. ” She said curtly.

” Anisha… I hope you understand. I don’t mean to be rude…” he said.

” Yeah yeah I get it. You are not being rude at all. ” She said taking his empty mug.

” So, we are cool? ” he asked following her down the stairs.

” Yes we are Viki. ” she said walking into the kitchen. She turned around ” Why wouldn’t we be? “.

” You know Anisha. I wanted to talk to you about something. ” He began.

She waited folding her arms supporting herself on the kitchen counter.

” I never apologized for my behavior the last time we met. I know you said you never wanted to talk about it. But, it was very immature of me to blurt out my feelings without considering our friendship. And I was acting really silly after that too. I should’ve been at the airport like a good friend would. I am sorry. I promise I won’t be such a sh*tty friend anymore. ” He said standing beside her.

Anisha was lost in her thoughts. 

” I should probably go. ” He said studying her face. ” I will stay in touch. ” He said smiling.

” You better. ” She said trying to smile.

He took his backpack and was heading out. He muttered a bye and was walking towards the door. Anisha expected him to turn but he didn’t.

” Viki.” She called out realizing she said it out loud this time. 

He halted mid step and turned around.

” Yes? ” He asked.

She was just staring at him visibly torn in indecision.

” What’s the matter Anisha? You okay? I think you need to sit down. ” he said throwing his back pack down and looking concerned.

” I am fine. ” she said. He took a step back. ” I mean physically I am. But I am not fine. ” She said struggling for words. 

” What do you mean? I am getting worried. You look like you are in pain. What can I do to help? Please tell me! ” He said looking concerned.

” I don’t know Vikram. I don’t know what I mean. Just stay. Don’t go. ” She said turning away. 

” I don’t understand Anisha.” he walked carefully towards her. ” I guess I could stay for an hour. ” he said trying to stay calm. 

” An hour Viki? That’s it? We knew each other for two years. And you can’t spend some time with me? You just stop by suddenly. Say some non sense and now you want to leave?” she said still not looking at him. 

” Hey. You are getting me wrong. I really have other plans. But if you wan’t me to stay a while, I will. Gladly. ” He said smiling and reaching out to her.

” You are crying.” he managed to say.

Anisha stayed silent. She couldn’t open her mouth. The grief was overwhelming.

” Is it because of me? Was I being rude? ” he waited for her to say something.

” Anisha please say something. The last thing I want to do is hurt you. ” he begged.

She somehow managed a muffled response. ” Then  don’t go. Stay.”

” I am sorry I couldn’t really get that. Do you want some water? ” Vikram said making her sit on the chair.

He then realized he was holding her shoulders. He left her immediately shrugging a sorry. ” I will get some water okay? ” he rose from his knees.

She still couldn’t speak. She held his hand to stop him from walking to the kitchen. ” Wait.” she said. When words failed her she wrapped her other hand around his neck in an effort to hug him.

He laughed  pulling himself away from her. ” I will stay. You needn’t try to be nice to me. Its okay Anisha. I have feelings for you. You don’t. That is alright dude. ” he said putting her hand back on her lap. 

” You don’t understand. ” she said trying to stop him. 

He sat on his knee waiting for her to speak. 

” I know I said I never want to talk about this. But I am now. I like you. I like you a lot. I always did. When you said those words I freaked out. I thought I’d be stuck in a relationship. You know how I freak out sometimes. ” She took a breath and continued. ” Yes, I wasn’t in love with you then. But I never wanted to leave you. I waited for you at the airport and when you didn’t show up I called you. Like a million times. I wanted to say more than just a good bye in the last message. I wanted to say I’ll miss you. A lot.” She looked at him to see if she made any sense at all.

He just looked at her waiting for her to say more. 

” And man.. Did I miss you?! I couldn’t pass a street without thinking what you would’ve done there. I couldn’t drink or eat without thinking what you would say about it. And some other crazy stuff. You will probably laugh. ” She said smiling through the tears.

” Say the crazy stuff. ” He said holding her hand. ” It sounds good.”

” I don’t know why. It made me anxious to be away from you. I hated the thought of you seeing someone else. Right… Now I am really talking crazy stuff. I have no right to think that you are mine.” she said looking at her hand in his.

” Go on.” he said playfully.

” You are enjoying this. ” she said. ” I know that was a bit crazy for me also. I do want something serious with you Vikram. I want to be stuck in a relationship with you. This job, new friends, exciting city didn’t keep me from thinking about you. I need you. I am not saying this because I am afraid of losing you. I am terrified but I am saying this because I have fallen in love with you. I sometimes think I always was in love with you. I just realized it later. I guess you never know the value of something until you… ” her words were cut short by his lips on hers.

She was smiling when he finally stopped. ” I am sorry Anisha. I just felt like kissing you. ” he said sheepishly.

” I am glad you stopped me. I would’ve been talking forever otherwise. ” she said holding his hand firmly.

He kissed her hand and said, ” But please continue. ”

She inched closer and said, ” What if I don’t want to talk anymore?” 

He was breathless for a moment. 

” Anishaaaa…” he sighed,” You.. you are wonderful.. you are a beautiful amazing woman. You know that right? Thanks for telling me all those wonderful things. This day can’t get any better. ”

” You are not leaving tomorrow, are you? ” she said running her hands over his face. 

He burst out laughing. ” You believed that! ” She looked confused.

He took her face into his hands. ” I came here to see you. It took me two weeks to find your address. I just had to see you. I love you. ” he said planting a kiss on her forehead. 

” Vikram. I love you. I always will. ” she tilted her head and kissed his lips. 

” You are attacking me.  Take it easy tiger.” he laughed  when they finally broke the kiss.

” You have no other choice now. You are mine. ” She said hugging him. 

” Gladly yours. Say that again.” he said hugging her close.
