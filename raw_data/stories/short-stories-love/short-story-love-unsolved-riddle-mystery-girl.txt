Love Short Story – Unsolved Riddle of a MYSTERY GIRL $@

 from 

She is a forever mystery to me. Even now when she has gone far from me , living in the other city. Her mysteries are unfolding one by one. Some words she said before but I was too dumb to understand that before but now its like I m following her footsteps , finding clues she left behind .

May be she always wanted somebody to follow this mysterious path and know things about her , things that she could never say from her mouth , things that can only be understood by someone who knows her from inside. Or may be this is just the part of my perfect imagination that made me see, what I always wanted in my life . May be her clues are just the co-incidence but series of co-incidences put me in the situation where I question myself

” do you want me to love or go away ? Do you want me to solve mystery or there is another mystery man to solve it ?”

Mystery of my mind

But now my decision is independent . It don’t rely on what you think . I know I had loved you the most but now its time to re-think and decide and this heart decided to love you forever . You are like that one beautiful girl who are there in the movies and novels . You are like the genre of music to me that hit my ears and directly goes into my heart and move back and forth (#pal_pal_dil_k_pass) and I’ll follow the footsteps as far as they are visible and I’ll wait even longer in the dark time to see those footsteps again when the sun shines because this way we’ll have a unique, interesting and a different love story from others that you can tell your grand children , but make sure their grand father should turned to be a HERO in this story.
