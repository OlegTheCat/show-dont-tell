It was too painful when I saw him with another girl. They were kissing, laughing, whispering at each other, simply enjoying themselves. For the first time, I saw his genuine smiles-something that I never saw when we were together.

I confronted him. He’s been cheating from me for four months, with his college friend, a famous athelete and someone who have known him for too long. I wanted to believe that everything was just a dream, and that he’s just making me jealous , to surprise me.

But I was wrong. He really loved her. He loved her more than me.

“I heard about your break up with Kiefer. I’m sorry.” I looked up and saw someone who’s been my best friend since I started college.

This guy always say that he likes me, and that he wants us to be together. But I chose Kiefer, and in the end, I got hurt because I chose the wrong man.

And now, Alvin is back on my side making me think, again. Why not him? I should have chosen him in the first place. I should have listend to my mom when she said that Kiefer will not do any better. And that he’ll only hurt me because he’s a known cheater.

I want to experience real love. But I also want to experience the feeling of cheating. I agreed when Alvin asked me out. So I agreed when he asked me if we could be together. But like I’ve said, I want to get revenge and let Kiefer see that he hurt the wrong person. Maybe he thought that I’m too soft hearted so he cheated on me? Well, I’m not as fragile as he think I am. I could cheat, too. I could also did what he did to me.
