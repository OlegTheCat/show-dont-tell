He was in my mind like everyday.

 This time his hands were in mine and my lips were against his .

 What about the others ? Who cared!

” Why do you bother so much ? Relax , would ya ?” I burst out a short laughter.

“That’s because . . . you’re too special” He said reflexly.

My eyes were about to come out of it’s sockets . The butterflies in my stomach were performing pirouette. All of a sudden , he seemed radiant. His eyes ? So naive. For the first time in my life , I got to know that my heart didn’t only pump blood . It did a few more things which didn’t come to my notice earlier.

He was not a man of words . I knew he wasn’t . I didn’t know him for nothing since fifth grade.

 I was so stupid back then that i didn’t even realise his existence in my class. And when i did , “Hatred” , yeah that’s what i had for him.

The guy who always stuck his head with his basketball and couldn’t even do a basket.

 Till this date , I don’t even know how he got into the school team.

The coach was just another nincompoop in our mad school , perhaps ? Haha. Never mind.

How fate plan to do all these unexpected things. When I give it a thought , even for a second. I lose it all . It’s complicated than Einstein’s brain. Period.

 What I am trying to say is that how I could I ever fall for that guy ?

Is it even possible to have feelings for the one whom you have hated for like forever ? Even the thought of him explains you the word “Odious”

 Is it even possible that suddenly you want to be with him forever ?

Never mind. Stupid questions. They happened already , didn’t they ?

Lore of love. Hmm. Sounds great , happens stupid.

So back to the conversation we are .

 I hated him for saying those words. He melted me like hot chocolate every time you vomited out his words of flame.

” I want him”

 Where did that come from, again ? It echoed every time.

” I like you!” he said.

” I know that . Tell me something i don’t.” I stifled my laughter. Obviously he didn’t expect that .

To that , well , i was trying to compete with my fate .

” Well then , I love you!”

Wait . Wait. My face is getting warm.

Wait. Let me check in the mirror .

Crap! It’s red.

Crap! I’m blushing.

Stop it !

Stop it !

Pipi! Stooop !

I think you should run away ! No No No … maybe you should slap him ? Or or … never mind!

Ugh!

You’re not supposed to love ogres. You’re not that type nor he is Shrek . You do remember what happened last time , don’t you ?

But he does make me glow . No no .. Don’t listen to your heart . Daft that part is .

Okay okay . I will tell him the truth.

Cool , go for it .

But what am I going to say ?

Oh Geez , they’re coming out . Oh noooo !

” I love you , Shrek!”

You wanted to say the truth . My heart winked !

 

” Oh so now we’re loving ogres , aren’t we ?”

My mom nudged me with her taunt and brought me into my senses.

“No I was just …. umm..” I stammered.

“Uh- ha ?” He smirked.

” Mother! Never mind. ” I was pestered .

And she did her job pretty well.

He texted.

Photos, they started this . Everything!

 They send to a another world . The aesthetic one to what we call “Memories”. Break me for a while !

I placed the accused back in the albums and reached my wardrobe.

If one thing now I had loved about my life , it was that stupid ogre!

No, i won’t describe how I dressed up . It was not a concern with him. Wearing a fake mask was. He loved me for my insides keeping aside my outsides. He knocked at the door and entered.

I looked back at him and smiled.

I really needed to work on my warm cheeks .It’s dangerous.

“Look at you! You’re blushing.” He grinned.

That grin which levelled up the red shade on my face.

“No, I’m not” I blushed.

i looked in the mirror even when I was certain about it.

He held out his hand.

“Shall we ?”

Oh I would die for that smile. Phew!

“Yes , we shall.”

And we headed not for a happy-ever-after life but just a date.

A beginning to what was going to end.

” I want him”

Now I knew where did that come from.
