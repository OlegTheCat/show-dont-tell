Among the bunch of pens in the stand, she picks up the one with the least amount of ink in it.

 Settling down on the chair nearby, she begins.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The pen is now empty and her heart, in comparison, is full.

 She folds the letter neatly and clutches it tightly.

 Getting up from the desk, hiding a few wisps of her now grey hair behind her ears, she walks over to the bed where her husband is now lying.

 As she brushes the hair off his forehead, she realizes how age has taken a toll on him.

 Their fifty years together have been magical but God seemed to have thought it was enough.

 Another tear escaping her eyes, she holds his hand and puts the letter into it.

 “Think that this letter is me” She says, kissing his forehead. “Take it with you.”

 Her husband hasn’t moved in over a week.

 But now, with the letter in his hand and her delicate fingers in his, he squeezes them.

 She looks at him through her tears, feeling the pressure of his fingers on her own, knowing that he has breathed his last.

 But what she notices is that the letter is still clutched tightly in his hand.

 Walking over to the window, she protects her wedding ring with her hand, knowing that she has hardly another five years left to live.

 With him by her side, five years would have passed by in a flash.

 But now these five years will seem endless.

 Behind her, the door opens.

 Without turning, she knows it is Jack and Natasha, the only two people in the world by her side.

 The three of them hug and cry, knowing that this friendship shall last a lifetime.

 Just like their love did.
