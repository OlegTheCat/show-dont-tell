Love Short Story – Pain

Very true quote. Only people who have experienced this feeling, know how much it hurts. I too never knew ‘what pain is?’ until she showed me. She made me feel that, I’m the only person, struck in some darkest side of the universe, that has only entry but no exit way. It’s like, there is no valid reason for my existence.

By the way I’m krishna working in ICICI bank as provisionary officer. And this my sad tale about a girl in my life.

Why did she put me in such a situation? I never expected this from her. I trusted her a lot. In no time she broke everything into pieces, just like pieces of a broken mirror that can never be put together again.

I don’t know, how I am going to erase all these memories from my mind? It’s impossible. I’m going to miss each and every second of my life here. I’m smiling outside but my heart is silently crying inside. I feel like my heart being pulled out from my body.

But she doesn’t seem to be sad or upset. She is here, right in front of me enjoying her favorite black current ice cream with her friends, reminding me of the day when I saw her for the first time.

She was wearing a white saree with a thin golden border. Matching ear rings and pendants added to her beauty. For me, she looked like a fairy tale character that escaped from one of my childhood fairy tale stories. Yeah, she is a fairy tale character but not a fairy, a cruel witch.

Of course she is a witch. Otherwise she would not have called me as soon as I entered the office yesterday and

 told me

“I am transferring you to vellore branch of our bank. You are leaving this branch in a couple of days”

That’s the reason for my pain ,since I have to leave everyone I’m working with here

And ‘she’ is the assistant manager of the bank I’m working in , responsible for all my pain !!
