Love Short Story – Invisible Love

I wonder how many times she has noticed me. She hasn’t acknowledged me at all. I feel as if she could walk right through me at any moment. He has stood in her room many times before; never noticed. Eye contact has yet to be made. He loves everything about her but trying to communicate with her is like talking to a brick wall. It’s as if he’s not there.

I follow behind her when she walks through the house. She’s a real mystery. At times I’m confused. Her family doesn’t talk to each other much. Their just kind of there. He always thinks about ways to say hello. Should he just come out and say hello, holding his hand out or should he surprise her by knocking on her window holding a dozen roses. The more I think about it the more unrealistic it is. Why would she even said hello to me. I’m not really the popular type.

But she’s a different story. She’s absolutely stunning. Long shiny black hair that runs down her black. Beautiful grey eyes; I’ve never seen anyone with grey eyes until I saw her. During the night, he leaves and walks around her town. Waiting for the sun to rise.

When the sun rises he is finally going to say hello. Heading off to the meadow he decides to bring her Cherokee roses. Their beautiful just like her. After he picks 12 roses, he walks back to her house. The sun has just started to rise when he gets there. It feels like my heart is going to beat out of my chest. Looking through the window, he sees her sitting at her computer.

Knock knock knock.

I wait for her to look up and see the roses, but she never does. She doesn’t even look away from the computer. He opens the window himself and steps into her room. Just as he closes the window she gets up and walks toward him.

At first he smiles but then everything changes. She walks by him and her shoulder goes right through his. He didn’t know that he was dead…but now he does.
