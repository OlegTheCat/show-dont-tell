Love Short Story – A Prologue For “Chasing Pavements”

When I was a child, I use to believe in fairy tales since I once used to live like a princess. A loving parents, a younger brother and a well-off life. I could get anything I wish back on those days, anything my younger self wanted.

Sometimes I wished to turn back time and spent most of my time on those days. Yet, we all know how impossible it could be. Now it’s all just a memory, a distant memory. And as a days passed by, you’ll get into thinking, 

Just like love when it first strikes and left you hanging, leaving you mending with those broken pieces of yours after falling so deep to someone who caught you in the early part of the story but ended up letting go of those hands that were holding his back. In fear of losing him, you held on to him for a longer time, setting aside how his were slipping from your hold and only a matter of time before you fell into deep and dark abyss waiting in still under you and in the end would lead you to thinking, 

Love, I never knew what it means aside from those brief sweet moments I saw between my mom and dad before their separation. Love, I never knew how complicated it is aside from those I watched on dramas. And the love that I know is what I’ve read before in the Bible. 

Love never ends.

The thing that my parents, with the fact that it ended, was it love or not? Or it just wasn’t enough from the start?

Love never ends.

The thing between us, it hadn’t ended and hadn’t started, was it love or not? Or is it just me dreaming? One thing I know about this, love or not, it isn’t easy to forget and it isn’t easy to give up.

–END–
