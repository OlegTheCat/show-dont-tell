I don’t know anything about the writing but felt that this should be written as I believe that if a word once created, It will remain till the eternity of Universe.

In Life there are two things which we do everyday, Struggle and Surrender.

In Love also, these two things needs to be there for a long lasting relationship from both sides.

In couple both of them can follow this phenomenon to take their relationship to higher level, where nothing else is required except The company of each other.

I have personally experienced this thing that consciously or unconsciously, In True Relationship, these two things are there automatically, i.e., if your are truly in love with someone and you are getting the same from the other side, Surrender and Struggle will be experienced.

In Mcleodganj (TOURIST PLACE IN INDIA) with my friends, I was in the Car, suddenly a girl, looking Gorgeous, looked at me and gave a sweet smile. I was astonished that what she, such a gorgeous girl, had found in me and gave such a smile and you should believe that with deep black eyes and fair color, such a smile can attract even a 90 years guy. I smiled back and wanted to follow her and talk to her. But somehow, she disappeared.

Later, I told to my Girl about the incident and I am lucky that I got such a cool minded mate. She first did not said anything and nodded in my statement. Then she said one thing that “if same happens with me, what do I do then?”

Then I realized that when you are in Love with someone so deeply, then You have to fight with your lust and surrender before her true love. At that point, I felt the Rule of Struggle and Surrender and since then, I kept my lust within me and remembered my Mate’s smiling when she was with me.

Thanks for reading.
