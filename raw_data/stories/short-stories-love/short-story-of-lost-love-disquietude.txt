Disquietude – Short Story of Lost Love

Alas, the moment he had imagined and shuddered at had finally arrived! Strangely an inexplicable weakness engulfed him. What was it that silently gnawed away inside him? He tried hard to figure it but all he could fathom was his numbness to the all-too-familiar feeling.

Feeling restless he got up from the rusty chair. The creaking sound drew unwanted attention infringing his treasured solitude. Mustering all his strength he tried to break the barrier of piercing, inquisitive looks. Yet all he could manage was a few small and unsteady steps. What was it that hindered his movement, he wondered! Adjusting his specs he turned his gaze to a tiny dot in the distance. Yes, it had arrived! The pounding became louder. He quickly glanced across the surrounding crowd. Did they get a glimpse of the silent storm he was weathering? The unknown emotions on the unknown faces didn’t reveal much. Grimacing in pain he stared at the soft imprints his shoes had created – a reminder that he was here.

As the dot grew bigger a sense of unexplained expectation gripped them. He could sense it – a sea of eyes was staring in the same direction. Seconds later,with a thunderous sound it came to a standstill. And the usual jostling for space started. Was it the prologue to a new story where he would be one of those mere forgotten characters?

Disturbed, he turned back one last time looking for solace in those imprints. A bitter truth dawned upon him – the futility of trying to leave a mark behind when time cared for none. As disillusion spread its invisible cloak around him, something caught his attention. Another speck in the distance! He stared hard at it this time looking for the ever elusive answers. Before long he broke into a wry smile- at least her memories won’t be wiped off.
