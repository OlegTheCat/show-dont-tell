My love story was going more than awesome yesterday when suddenly I felt that I am dead inside.

I got to know that he is cheating on me once again.

He is breaking my trust once again.

So, How had he cheated me previously?

Had he slept with just another girl?NO

Had he not loved me?I don’t know.

So, what could be the reasons behind my these sharp blames on him.

For the first time cheating, he confessed that he cheated me by making stories of his life, his family, his every now and every then.

I was living those imaginary moments with him which he had made so real to me.

But everyone deserves a chance right?

I too thought the same and made him the whole part of my life.

Loving him with my whole heart, Giving him a place that I may not now give to some another person.

Now, How does he broke my trust for a lifetime which became the reason for the Death of my Emotions?

He lied to me once again.

He made stories once again.

He was slowly and tactfully using me for money, and now he started that with my parents too.

I am broken, I am restless, but I will not give him a second chance this time.

I am lucky to know the truth before much damage.

The money can be earned, but the pieces of a broken heart can not be put together again.

I will show the real misery of his life now.But I may not love someone back again with the same heart that I had given to him with a trust.I may still love him forever for the rest of my life but I may not forget what he has done to me.

Today, I witness the death of my emotions.
