It wasn’t exactly a night of bliss but somehow seemed impressive. Really, intuitions played a scorching role. Everything seemed strange. Was it because of the whiskey??? Huh!!!! Couldn’t be. I could feel the cold. I realized the coldness was coming from her. But, eventually it had been pouring through out the day. Why was this chill on my spine? I was confused but I had to go my way.

Esha looked at me. The car keys in her hand and her hair dishevelled. Her question did have an answer. But I didn’t have one, really. “Sameer, are you alright???” I wasn’t. How could I be when I was talking to the woman who just broke up with me? Yes, was my reply.

She pulled on the handbrake, relaxed herself on the front seat, leaned her head over the windowsill and closed her eyes. I turned to look at her. Every breath that she took reflected on the window as if the rain drops outside were trying to play with it.

Five years of togetherness, broken in two minutes. Esha was going away to London. Her father’s a general manager there at a mammoth firm and me, a third grade inefficient clerk at a broken city office, bunched up with rats and roaches. And Esha, simple, innocent beauty.

“Sameer, look at me,” she said. I didn’t. She was crying and tears rolled down her beautiful cheeks. I was awestruck over the sight that i can not even stop myself from admiring her. I wished i could weave those tear drops into the shiniest glitter that could ever glaze.

“Sameer, I have to go,” she remarked and stopped abruptly. Her eyes wet and with a staggering tone she pronounced, “Sameer, you would always remain a sweetheart,” and left me beside the sidewalk, where we used to meet and cherish those wonderful “we-times”.
