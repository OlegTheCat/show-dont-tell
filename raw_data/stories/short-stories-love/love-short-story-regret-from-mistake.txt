I guess this wasn’t called love. He was married and seemed unhappy but those were only words that he used to weakened me. What made him think that I was an easy target? I was so young that I should have been studying school more rather that becoming a sauce of sweets. In his eyes I was only thought to see . Where did I end up in his heart?

He had promised the world  too me but I knew that their were all false. I told him to stay with her because his love for her was endless. As months went I became pregnant that i hid everything from my parents because I knew they expected better of me. He told me if I really loved him that I would do it for him which is to give up his child. I was so heartbroken that I couldn’t sleep most nights because I heard my child’s voice playing in my head; I was so foolish to give up the only being that would really love me which was my child.

Yes guilt plays on my heart and mind this is regret from a mistake that has thought me about life. I couldn’t bare to be with him so I left but over the years these are a few things that kept me going: tears, pain and then strength. My child will continue to be in my heart and my love is priceless for him. What the hell was I doing with a married man? Being young to him was a way to take advantage of me and to take away my teenage life. ‘He said to me, having a child would take away everything from us’. It was clear to me that he didn’t want us.
