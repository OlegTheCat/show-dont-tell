I loved him so much that it seemed impossible for it to drift into the ocean. Like other couples we too had plans for the future.

My world began to swirl upside down when I found out he had another lover behind my back. Questions asked and answers given weren’t adding up. I was so young ,attractive and beautiful at the same time and he was a bit older. I guess that the sweets were only keeping him for awhile. Even though I had tears running down my cheeks and pain in my heart that it was best to let go.

For me he wasn’t the ending to my world because reality became clearer and lessons I learnt along the way. Yes my love story ended years ago because my heart was trapped in the wrong place and then I became free like the wind and as fresh as the springs. I all do is smile back at those memories because today I am stronger. Chance ,change and choice has been my words to life for me.

The broken will pickup the pieces along the way and smile through it all. I could not believe that he left me for someone else and told me he no longer need me. He left me for her even though I thought I did everything right to keep him. Maybe I was young and foolish to think that a man like him would ever settle for a girl like me who left home instantly to live with him.  Tear’s came down my eyes to see and hear the words he said to me.

I now knew that he never loved me so I just moved on with life and forgot. He never cared for me like I did for him.

–END–
