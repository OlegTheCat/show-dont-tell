Story of Crush of a Boy for a Teenager Girl

 from 

It was a sunny day and we were to go for Sripuram to visit goddess Narayani temple. We just finished our kanipakam Vigneswara darshan and were sitting on a bench in the bus stand waiting for the bus which will take us to Sripuram. My younger sis and I were having fun laughing and joking. Suddenly, I noticed a guy staring at me. He was a tall, good-looking teenager ( I don’t how old was he) but was looking a little elder to his age. Also there was a man along with him, may be his uncle (I don’t know exactly) who was not so aged.

I ignored it and continued talking to my sis and after desperately waiting for 2hrs finally the bus arrived and there was a huge crowd standing in front of the bus to get inside and to reserve seats for their relatives. Some how my dad managed to get a seat and asked this guy to reserve a seat for us and he did that. My sis and I sat in a seat behind him (actually reserved by him for us). He stood up and asked me something. Though he was speaking the same language but his accent was different and for a while I couldn’t understand what he was speaking then I understood that he was asking me to look down for bottle I searched down the seat and found nothing and told the same to him. He smiled at my innocence because he wanted to talk to me and found bottle as a cause. I didn’t understood all this at that sixteen years of age. His uncle laughed at his attempts (Such a supportive uncle or friend right! :))

After traveling for 2hrs finally the stop has come and we were about to get down. I was sick then with cold and cough troubling me much. I was coughing too much and and my mom didn’t had a water bottle. This guy noticed me coughing took a bottle from his bag (don’t imagine that he offered it to me) and he started drinking looking at me and expecting that I would ask him. I didn’t do anything of that sort and soon we got down from the bus.

My dad bought a water bottle for me. When I suddenly turned back I saw this guy searching for me he found me and stood beside me. Another bus came which will take us to temple and I moved from there. We reached temple and I didn’t find him anywhere. As it was an auspicious day there was a people rushed to the temple. The temple authorities have arranged compartments so that devotees can be made to wait there whenever there will be a rush. And so we were made to wait in compartments.

It was 4 in the evening but as it was summer the evening was still brighter. The sunrays were falling on my face so I kept my hand against my face to oppose the rays from falling on my face. Then again I saw this guy going infront of me and was standing at a queue. After waiting for few minutes we were asked to come out of the compartments and were allowed to join the queue and our queue started moving. I had a pleasant darshan of Maa Narayani and was about to move from there. There again I saw this guy and he was again searching for me but he couldn’t find. And the man with him found me and showed him. The guy followed us wherever we went.

I’m much interested to read books on the places I visit so I bought a book on that place and temple and he noticed it and took a book and read. (Dont know whether he bought it or not) we moved faster in fact I insisted my dad to hurry up as it was getting dark. That was only an excuse, the truth is I don’t want the guy to follow me. Somehow I succeeded in my plan but to my surprise I found him again, he was sitting on a bench and was waiting for me. To my embarrassment, he laughed at me because I was eating a laddu which is bigger than what my mouth could hold and I couldn’t chew it. Again he started following me and I started escaping from him. Then there was a wooden barricade which I had to cross. As I couldn’t jump over it I moved through the space between the barricades. To make me understand how to jump over a barricade he came there and jumped over it. He tried all the possible ways to impress me. Our visit to temple was over and we caught a bus to kanipakam again. Thank god this time he was not in the bus.

But again in Kanipakam we had to take another bus and my dad found a bus and asked us to come. I said no dad, we will take another bus because it is already full (but the actual reason is he was in the bus and was listening to our conversation and was about to vacate the seat for me). Dad agreed and we sat in the bus stand waiting for the bus. Mom and dad were talking and I opened the book which I bought. To my surprise he came there, stood between two buses and was asking something to me. I got tensed and hid from him. I don’t know what he thought and moved from there. Soon we caught another bus which was opposite to the bus where he was and I saw him but he didn’t. But he was searching for me… Our buses started and still he was searching for me but couldn’t find me.We reached our destination and in the meanwhile we changed two other buses but didn’t find him anywhere.

I don’t know what all this can be called as. I can’t call it as love but may be I can quote it as a crush. A crush of a boy for a girl. Whatever, whenever I remember and recall the incident a smile automatically comes on my lips.
