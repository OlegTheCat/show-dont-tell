[Story of an Unheard Voice – Love Short Story]

“So you haven’t memorized my mobile number is it?” asked Shweta. Her face was reddened with anger.

“Give me a break, Shweta. Why the hell should I memorize your number? It’s stored in my mobile. You know it’s quite difficult for me to remember anything” shouted Sanjeev

“What will happen if you lose the mobile?” she asked.

“I need not reply to all these silly questions..” he shot back to her.

They both were silent and staring at the sea.

Sanjeev & Shweta are colleagues. They did their graduation from the same college and recruited by the same company. It was only during their induction, they realized their love for each other. Their love is almost two year old now. Off-late they are having lot of fights & patch ups.

“Shall we start?” Sanjeev asked breaking the silence.

“Okay.” She replied

“Let me drop you at your P.G” he told her staring his bike

“No. I will take an auto. “ Shweta replied

“Okay” he replied

She took an auto & went to her P.G. He went back to his place. She hasn’t sent a message or called him. He was feeling bad now.

He typed a message “Hi, Had dinner?” ignoring the 

She saw the message & thought for a second.

Yes I had. She replied to his message.

Look at her. She can’t even type an extra word or appreciate my efforts. She’s totally impossible. All she wants is my complete attention. Why the hell I should bend for her every time? He threw away his mobile and went to bed.

She waited for further message from him. Can’t he understand what am I thinking? Why he is he so difficult these days? He is not the same person anymore. She went to bed with tears in her eyes.

They both ignored a voice screaming “Can you please listen to me? You are making a mess out of nothing”
