And the day arrived, he traveled 12 hours to her city and met her at a cafe as they planned, she looked weak and he knew the weakness was because of the sleepless nights she spent crying her heart out, he wanted to hug her as it was more than a year they last met but then he remembered the cause for his visit and stopped himself. They wanted to meet for one last time before they part ways. She brought the expensive watch he gifted her, just to return him back.
