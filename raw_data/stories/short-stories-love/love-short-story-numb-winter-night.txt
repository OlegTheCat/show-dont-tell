All the winter nights I survived never felt so cold until this moment, though the jungle melody is playing a soothing base with the hushing trees; dancing leaves supporting the rhythm of the hollow six strings…

Did I deserve this Loneliness?

“I whispered to the winds…

Will I end up sacrificing myself to music?

” Questioning my troublesome thoughts”

I remember that serene mesmerizing aura, her walk in the morning, her small dazzling steps as she used to roam while talking. A snowwhite glance that used to reconstruct my world out of nothingness.

I often wonder what is love?

Is it all about acceptance?

Or is it about escape?

I remember her humble words as she detected my lies, her warm hands telling me it’s alright; you’ll be alright. As if she created a cosmic circle I used to dissolve myself in, coming out with peace nothing more to adhere.

I often wonder what is love?

Is it all about acceptance?

Or is it about escape?

I remember the first time my eyes caught her sight as if a Goddess I was witnessing with a halo and a whole band of angels to play those love birds nymphamatic rhymes, one moment it was; was everything.

I often wonder what is love?

Is it all about acceptance?

Or is it about escape?

All the winter nights I survived never felt so cold until this moment, though the jungle melody is playing a soothing base with the hushing trees; dancing leaves supporting the rhythm of the hollow six strings…

Will I reach the shore?

Will she be happy once more?

Will I be able to bring her back?

Will I resolve what all I lack ?

All the winter nights I survived never felt so numb until this moment

A cold numb winter night
