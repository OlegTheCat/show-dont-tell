As they say … all good things come to an end … so I guess this is it… the end … the time to say goodbye

Three years of my life here and it feels like forever…

Love over Coffee-Love Short Story

Life surely will not be the same again…not without the morning bus rides, skywalk, food courts, Bulletin Board and CCD… CCD the place where a lot can happen over coffee and a lot actually did …

Friday morning…. clear azure skies… warm sun… and me on time to catch up with friends… perfect start to the day. What more did I want! Coffee… yes my regular cup of coffee at CCD…

“One Cappuccino please”…

“One Latte for me”….

That was the most amazing voice I have ever heard… I look back… I simply had too …

I look back and find what… ? Deep-blue eyes that I could drown in forever…… !!!

Suddenly there was magic in the air…. something tugged at my heart strings…

I could see stars and hear bells…

“Stars! Bells! Get a hold on yourself.”… I say to myself… take the coffee and walk away…

Stupid cupid was doing his rounds…

“Excuse Me”…

“OMG! He wants to talk to me!”… a sly grin formed on my lips….

“I think you have taken my latte by mistake”…

“Ooh… oops…” I hand over the coffee… and walk again… my blonde moment!

Monday Morning… missed the bus, missed breakfast and missed a heartbeat… ‘Familiar face there’… suddenly I miss a step and fall flat on my face…

“I think you have fallen for me”… with a knowing smile and a hand stretched out…

I take the hand… mutter a “thank-you”… and try to walk away with false poise… but “Damn!”… I trip again..!!! I didn’t dare look back…. my embarrassing moment!

Tuesday… Wednesday … the days stopped to matter… Cupid …stealthily but steadily was at his work…

A glimpse here … a stolen glance there… life was full of budding promises…

Another Friday morning… a spring in my step… a song on my mind and ‘damn the work attitude’… there is really something about Friday mornings … coffee only adds to the charm of it…

I wait at CCD for my coffee… “Hi”… my heart does a somersault…and my knees turn jelly… ‘

’ I thought… I was in a trance… tongue-tied and unable to respond… before I realized he walks away…

The thought troubled me at the back of my mind…all day long …

I decide to set this right….

New day…new hopes…new shirt and a dash of my favorite perfume… …I walk in to CCD… 

… I stomp off to my desk… and work like never before…

…  I am again at CCD… sight the same gal with him … too much for me to take…the green eyed monster – jealousy takes over me…  I stalk away…. I sulk…I crib…

Days pass by… but the feeling of having lost something precious does not go away… for long I am in a state of denial… denial that it was not mere attraction… denial that there was something more… something more like love…

Stupid Cupid is on a long holiday…

Today is my last day … an empty feeling within me… 

I had to ask…I had to know…

I send across a mail… asking him to meet me at CCD… the place where I first met him…

Sitting here at CCD…. thinking about things… funny… sweet… and stupid… an hour passed by … the evening sky changed to a dark blue sky… with the stars shining bright … but still no sight of him… 

… Time for me to leave then…. but not without my last cup of coffee here….

“One Cappuccino please”…

“One Latte for me”….

I look back…I simply had too…

I look back and find what…? Deep-blue eyes that I could drown in forever……!!!

Suddenly there was magic in the air….something tugged at my heart strings…

I could see stars and hear bells…

‘Oh John… I didn’t think you would come’…

‘Oh Jake….how could I have not’….

Stupid Cupid had struck!
