She hugged him tightly.He left her in home and asked her to come to a restaurant which was near to that bus stop next day after completing her work in office.In her office the work was going on well,suddenly after her lunch a group of gangster by covering their face came and knocked down their office fully by lighting the whole bundle of paper’s which was kept for printing by locking the main gate of that office.Unfortunately many of them in their office died and were injured in the place.Sameera escaped from the place by hiding herself.When one of the men in their gang jumped out from the wall his face cover fell down.She saw his face and that guy too noticed her.The office was full of mess.She was staying in her office up to evening and forgets about Suriya’s invite to restaurant.She gets call from him and she goes to that place.

It was a strange thing for him to see her coming in auto.He waved his hand from the opposite side of the road and she too waved.When she was about to cross the road a car ran over her.His smiling face turned to pale on seeing it.He shouted at that car driver in a filthy word and ran to save her but was unable to do anything,before the ambulance came she died in the bus stop on her birthday.He felt a lot for that cried,screamed like anything.His friends convinced him not to worry for that.Next day he came to know about her office issue and that disaster.Days were passing on and he was thinking about Sameera.On seeing it his friends were worried,in order to change him they all arranged for a marriage but he was not interested.

After few months he was married to a girl named Sindu.On the way while returning to home after his marriage he passed that bus stop and thinks about her,teared. After wiping his eyed when he saw the bus stop he was shocked to see Sameera sitting there. He was confused a lot and doesn’t know what to do. Sindu is a very calm and understanding girl. She knows everything about him but Suriya didn’t liked her and hesitates to see her face.

He makes a call to his friends and asks them to come to his house up stairs.He shouted at them badly and told them that Sameera is still alive and he also says to them that he saw her in the bus stop. His friends,all were confused on hearing to it because while burying her in graveyard all were there including Suriya.They convinced him and told that it was just an illustration but Suriya didn’t agreed to their words. All went,Sindu was waiting for him as it was late night,when he came she forced him to go to bed for sleep.He was unable to sleep and was thinking about that.He again ran to the graveyard were she was buried,he found her cemetery and started to dig.He was again puzzled to see her body which was lying in the ground.

It was raining he left home with lots of confusion and on the way he sits and relaxes in the bus stop.When he went to home Sindu questions him that where did he went.He doesn’t answers her and goes to sleep.Next day while going to his office on the way he sees that driver who drove the car on her,chases and catches him in a place where there was no one.The driver told that he was given money from an anonymous guy to kill that girl.While he was speaking to Suriya he was killed suddenly.Suriya was shocked to see his death in strange manner,he searched for a guy who killed the driver.When that driver fell down he saw Sameera standing in back of him.Suriya screamed like anything and was horrified.He ran out from that place and went to his home.Sindu saw some strange look at him and enquired about his activities.He didn’t told her anything,she compelled him to have dinner but he did not had.She was worrying about their life.She had no ideas regarding it.

Those gangster who created the mess in that office thought that the driver was killed by Suriya and plans to kill him.When he was going to office those guys thought of killing him.So they made some arrangements for that and was waiting near a signal in a car to shoot him.He came to that spot and when those guys took their gun to shoot him,unfortunately a lorry ran over that car and everyone in the car died.The public who were at that spot were shocked to see that terrible accident.Again he saw Sameera standing near that signal.She was frightening the people who were supporting that politician.

In one situation that politician became scared of her has the spirit of Sameera was torturing him in different ways.Later,that politician came to know about Suriya and he told his men to kill him as he was also involved in the case.It was late night,after having his dinner in a nearby hotel,he went for some relaxation to that bus stop.Those guys were following him.Those guys surrounded him and started to attack,he too fought up to his best but he was injured a lot.

Suddenly those guys scared on seeing Sameera and she attacked them.Those guys were sizzled and ran off,she did not left anyone of them and killed them.Suriya was seeing those things lively and was unable to believe those scenes as they were so bad and scary.After that incident he went and sat in the bus stop.He was thinking about that incident when he turned,he again saw Sameera sitting next to her.Sameera told him not to panic and he realised it to be the spirit of her.

She told him that“I didn’t died in the accident and it was a pre-planned murder.Its all because of that politician Devan who was doing illegal business in the state and our magazine which covered about his business and his activities,his anger grew on our company”.(says those incident which happened before).

She also says that she was hiding and taking video of those guys and captured the guys whose mask fell down.(that guy who saw her and left)Because of that reason they killed her and took that clip.He asked her to calm down and told that he would prison Devan for his activities and requested her not to arm anyone.Devan was scared that the spirit may kill her.Inorder to prevent that spirit he did lots of activities.Suriya filed a case on Devan regarding the fire accident.It was night time Suriya went into the poticians house and finds that clip.He gets caught by the men’s in Devan’s house.

After a big fight he escapes,next day he produces that clip as an evidence to the judge.Sameera was standing next to him.In order to escape from the justice,Devan played a game and escaped from the crime by giving a huge sum to the judge.When he went out of the court he made a devilish smile on seeing him.Suddenly they all heard a sound from the upstairs of the court were the judge fell down and died.Devan was going in a car and Suriya was searching for Sameera and didn’t saw her.Suriya went in his car to his home and on the way both Devan and Suriya were standing parallel in traffic signal.

When Devan’s car went at first he saw Sameera at the back of Devan’s car in an anguish way.When Suriya shouted to stop him he did not stopped and drove the car,she killed him.Suriya drove to see that place were Devan’s body was floating on the blood.The cops closed that case by saying that it was an accident.All those incidents were taking next to the bus stop.He don’t know where and how to speak to her and realised that she left the world.When he went to home he felt happy for her and remembers about the words told by her that she asked him to take care of his wife Sindu and to live happily with her.He went to home and asked sorry to her for behaving badly to her.She doesn’t questions him for such activities and apologizes him and lives happily.
