A girl in her marriage interview, was sitting calmly, hesitating to look at the groom and his family. Everyone in groom’s family is happy that their groom has finally found his perfect alliance. When everything is going to get concluded about the marriage arrangements, the girl suddenly said, “can I talk to the groom for few minutes?”.

People let them to talk in a separate room. The girl, who has finally got freedom to open up herself started talki

“Did you really like me?” ,said the girl.

“Of course yes, why did you ask so?”, boy questioned the girl back.

“I don’t know if I’m correct at speaking all these at this time. But I want to make some things clear to you. Well, if you are looking for a beautiful stunning bride, I’m sorry I can’t be the one you want. But if you needed an average looking girl with a traditional family background, who respects your family along with you and expects the same from you, who can make you feel like your mother in caring, who stands with you in your bad times, who is ready to face the whole world just for you, and who always try to make you happy in every possible time, then I will be among your choices. You can never regret to have such a wife in your life and I can promise you that. And now, are you still ready to marry me?”

Groom with his weighed heart and tear filled eyes, sat in his knees extending his hand to her and said, “it’s not you but me who has to ask that question. I’ve always dreamt about my soulmate and you are the one whom I wanted. Will you marry me?”

They later got married and happily lived ever after !
