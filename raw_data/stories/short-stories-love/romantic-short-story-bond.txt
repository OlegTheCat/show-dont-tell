 from 

“ITS OVER…I can’t do this anymore.Its not love its attraction that we have” He said the words like it didn’t matter to break up after a year of relationship. Like he never loved her the way she loved him. And to think he considered it all an attraction it broke her heart to the core.

She stopped her tears midway she couldn’t let them flow. No she couldnt break down infront of him when she probably was nothing for him. Anya was pretty , cute and guys would look at her twice but she had not chosen the most handsome like everyone would assume. She had choosen a good looking chubby lad. For she believed he was different.

A guy who wouldnt break her heart. But now she felt it was a lie she had made herself believe. She just turned around and walked away from where they were standing few minutes ago kissing. She did not know how she felt because all she wanted to do right now was cry out loud. She had old fashioned type of thinking. Aarav was her first love, first guy she kissed and had sex with. She had wanted them to have a happy ending not what was happening right now.

She had given this relationship her everything just to make it work. And Aarav telling her that its not love and just an attraction, broke her heart into pieces. Yes she could have walked away pretending he was right and she did not care as well but if one thing she couldnt lie to herself. She knew Aarav probably got bored of her and wanted something new. But she refused to feel used. She refused to believe that he knew what he was doing to her. She hoped he was just confused about his own feeling and just wanted some time to think . So as she walked away she decided not to turn back to look at him one last time because she knew she would break down if she did.

*****1 year later****

Anya got out of the exam hall. It was her last exam today of her final year of M.A. She would be leaving this place tonight never to look back. A year had passed since Aarav had said those words but every night it came back to her like it was yesterday . She had cried every night since then and in the morning she pretended like its all ok with her. Like she was the happiest girl ever. But no she was broken and only her heart knew it. She went back to her hostel room with her friends and started packing . She had a flight tonight to get away from this cursed place. A single tear rolled down her cheek as she packed blocking away the memories.

*******

Aarav couldnt believe how stupid he had been . He let go of the only girl who loved him. How could he. Over the year he had seen her many times in college or hostel campus surrounded by her friends but the glow she had was long gone. Her smile didn’t reach her eyes and somehow it broke his heart that he was responsible for this. His confusion had gotten in the way . As he was packing to go away from the place where he had made the biggest mistake of his life he knew he couldn’t live that way. He stopped his packing and rushed out of the room calling Anya’s bestie on the way.

“Hello Dia” Aarav said when she picked.

“What do you want” Was the reply he got.

“I know you hate me for what i did to Anya but i really need to see her now before its too late” Aarav said

“Well it is too late she left for the airport half an hour ago” Dia said and cut the call.

“NO its not too late i wont let it be” Aarav told himself and rushed towards his car in the parking lot.

****

He reached the airport an hour later. He was afraid her flight had already left but he hoped and prayed she was still there waiting for the plane….for him..his heart said.He looked around everywhere . just as he was about to give up he saw her heading towards security check. He shouted her name “Anya”. Everyone including Anya looked at him. Anya turned and started to walk towards him.

As she reached  him he could see dried tears in her eyes. He just went down his knees…held her hand…looked at the floor because he was too ashamed to look into her eyes and spoke,

“I was a fool to let you go, to call what we had attraction,To let you fight your demons all alone for a year not realizing my biggest mistake. We have the perfect bond and i was stupid to neglect that. I was a messed up ass before you came to my life. You set me right. And i let you go. Please Anya give me a chance to make it all right . Marry me”

As he looked at her now he saw she was crying but she was also smiling as she said, “Get up you idiot.I will marry you”

And the people just clapped like the movies. As Anya hugged him he knew his life would be perfect again.

 

****7 years later****

Aarav and Anya were kissing in the kitchen of their small home when two little kids ran upto them shouting.

“Mommy ,Daddy…Ayyan won’t give me the toffee” Their 4 year old daughter Ahana cried hugging her daddy.

“Mommy tell Ahana its mine” Ayyan their 5 year old son retorted.

Aarav bent down infront of his little girl and said”Baby i will give you another toffee how about that”

“Ok”Ahana said and ran away smiling.

Anya looked at her son and said” Sweety she is your little sister, you must learn to share”

“Yes mommy”Ayyyan lowered his head .Then he turned towards the way Ahana had gone and shouted “Hey Ahana wait lets share”and ran the way she had gone.

Aarav and Anya just looked at their little ones and smiled and went back to kissing thinking how lucky they were to have such adorable smart kids.
