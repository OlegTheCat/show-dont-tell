Love Short Story – SUNDAY

Love Short Story – SUNDAY

It rained heavily last night!!

Morning was fresh with the scent of the first rains all over. Monsoons came earlier than expected. He was happy for it brought with itself the SUNDAY he was looking forward to from days. FRESH, CLEAN, BRIGHT, PURE…..

Naina was still not up. They had a party last night, Aakash’s first car, friends all over the place; it took a real while before they could make the-love-pad to We-can-live-again-pad.

3 months, he thought! He met her in one of the conventions at the Indian Habitat, she was well read, had eyes to die for and he was lost! Work played cupid, common clients too. They met almost daily for work and after work! And when at a private screening of one of the old classics, Judy Garland said

They knew it was the time to make the move. It was SUNDAY when she moved out of her settlement into his and they renamed it the-love-pad!

He had his share of fights, the usual and then the unusual ones, the cozy ones too, and it had been a joy ride with her. They loved with a love which was more than love. He proposed to her on a fine sunny day, just like this, took her hand in his and said, ‘I can no longer think of anything but you.  In spite of myself, my imagination carries me to you.  I grasp you, I kiss you, I caress you!!  You and you alone make me feel that I am alive.

All she had to say was ‘YES’ and she did! The D day was the following month and excited they were!

The shrieking door bell brought him back. He rushed, for the 

guy who always rung two. Strangely, he didn’t.

He opened the door and there SHE was, Ishika, his ex! Stunned, as if hit by a lightning!

3 years!! Been 3 years since he saw her last; 1 year since he was even remotely connected and three months since he even thought about her!!

He asked her in, offered her water and stared. She looked pale, older, lost and tired. Spectacled, unruly bun; she was not the one he knew.

A tear rolled down her cheek. She looked for the friendly pat on her back which always came when he was there. But wasn’t supposed to be there and it weren’t. She controlled herself.

Naina woke up from the noise in the living room

Aakash

Pat came the reply. And she was taken aback. From being My-world-revolves-around-you, she stood alone. Nobody. Hit her hard.

Heavy hearts!! Both of them had a lot to say, wanted to hold each other back…..

Was she the one? After all, he always wanted her, longed for her, and now that she has realized, was this the time to make the move? What if so late but eventually did!

And what about Naina? She took him in when he was all low, all broke, all despised. He would not betray her, not in this lifetime for sure but was this love? Yes, she would fight, not talk to him for days, unfriend him. But she would understand. That’s what she had done.

The night passed in confusion rolling like a pin ball on the new king size they ordered recently.

Breakfast! Thought he would tell Naina at the breakfast.

“Aren’t you going to the airport? I think you are getting late.”

Shocked! Astounded! Flabbergasted!

And she heard it all!!

Relieved! Comforted! Calm!

She understood. “Thanks!” said he and ran off!!

A tear rolled down her cheek.

He saw Ishika at the airport. She looked if nothing but hopeful. And it was then he realized the love had gone long back, memories faded with time, and there was nothing left. He just couldn’t move an inch towards her. Life completed a full circle for him.

And then he made THE call, “I knew you would understand but you didn’t. You let me go just like that. If you ask me how much I love you, I won’t say anything. I’ll just take your hand, fill the gaps between your fingers and hold on to you until all your doubts are gone. I love you so much 

!”

He headed back. Time was running fast and this time around, he wanted it to win the race.
