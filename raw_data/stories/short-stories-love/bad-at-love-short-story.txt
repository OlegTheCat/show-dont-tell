“You know I’m not good at these.. Relationship things..”

May turned around facing Danni.

“Well, I’m not either. We both had our hearts broken. But that doesn’t mean we can’t learn to feel again.”

Danni caressed her face. He felt her intense doubt.

“No. I’m serious. I’m not ready for this. I’m still young, I need to explore my options!” May jumped out of bed and put on her clothes.

“I’ll call you…” May said. She went towards the door then turned back.

Danni looked at her in confusion. “So your just gonna leave?? Really, May!? I thought we had something special. Damn..”

“Well you thought ahead of yourself. I fell asleep. We didn’t even do anything. You men tend to always think because I want to start talking to you, it means I wanna get in bed with you.” May scoffed and walked out of the bedroom.

She walked downstairs and rushed to the door. Then, when she opened it, she was stopped by Danni who yelled her name.

He walked up to her, grabbed her and kissed her passionately. “Please don’t go..” He held her.

May pulled away. “No. Stop. I already told you-”

“I love you.”

“No you don’t. You like the image of someone in bed with you.”

May pushed away and walked out of the door, slamming it behind her.

She walked out to the fresh spring season. Almost summer, full of hot babes, and martini drinks. May had commitment issues, ever since her ex, Dallas left her for her ex-BFF, Kourtney.

They got married. She was heart-broken. But she moved to a new town to avoid them. A town called Malibu. She had a cute and small apartment. But enough about her past. It’s all about how it affected her…
