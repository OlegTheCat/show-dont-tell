People around me always talk of love.But they really do not know what they really mean it. Each one has their own way of defining it…

 some says 

 some says” 

 And some other says

 ..But my friends I wanna ask you what really love is??….Surely it’s a feeling..But what feeling??How do this feeling come from?….

By looking in eyes of your special someone ? Or By being with them? ….NO! It isn’t exactly the same…It comes when you know who really you are When you are with them..When you are with them it’s a feeling of changes you feel in you.It’s a feeling of seeing yourself together as complete.. It’s a feeling of togetherness that can deal with any problem and can withstand any difficulty …

when you say it’s about live or die together… what you really mean.?

.In love it is never needed to live or die together but it is the moment when you are together that needs to be created by you.

If you love a person then You respect the person ,You care for the person and thus so you understand the person . So it don’t need you living or dying with the person but to always with the side of the person.

Love is the most pious word which is being used in most inappropriate manner by people all around us..Love can be between two friends. It can between mother and child/ Father and child, also apart from the love birds of today generation… And it need to be understood that holding the hands together and roaming around Or watching movies in theatre Is Not LOVE….It is far beyond that …Or better to say it is really very different from what we think of it …
