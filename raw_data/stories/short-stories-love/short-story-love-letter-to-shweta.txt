My dear Shweta , Dhanbad

 Dated 16th. August 2013.

Last midnight when I was lost in paradise embracing your lovely Didi under the crazy muscled arms, do you know what your Didi replied to my query– “ How do you feel when I exert my utmost to satisfy you externally as well as internally? ”

She kept mum as most of the women do so in replying such a silly (extremely undesirable one) question while indulged deeply in …?

 She turned her neck slightly right, closed her eyes for a moment, covered her face with right palm a little bit – dared to ask a question against a question ( my question ) , “ Didn’t you get the answer of such a question from your Rani ? ”

When she is annoyed, she addresses you as Rani instead of your name. Then I came to a conclusion that one woman is jealous of another in such a situation. If your Didi , then what wrong with her? Such quality in woman is inborn. Woman is, someone has quoted , the symbol of Lajja ( modesty ) by birth.

 I never conceal anything , you are well aware of the fact, from your Didi, moreover, one thing that is also important I take care of, is the right time and her pleasant mood that I use to take advantage of, disclosing even unusual thing in order to take her in sheer confidence or trust.

 In this context you are well acquainted that before we were ready for intercourse, once you asked me, ‘ Does Didi know about this ? Does Didi know that you sleep with me and sexually … ? ’

 I made it clear she knows everything. Once I was discussing about it and placed a question to her as to what I should do, what would be my course of action if I desire so or Shweta too, in my place or in that of Shweta , to give her opinion impartially, your Didi widened her eyelids, stared at me like a hungry lioness and changing the tongue immediately, being calm and quit replied confidently , ‘ No wrong in it , you can do , even both can enjoy as long as … ? I am happy, rather happier whatever you do , you do taking me in confidence , Shweta too , that is enough and to my entire satisfaction.

 Last midnight it was drizzling outside and we were listening to the musical sound coming out of continual rain. We were relieved of the heat of the scorching sun. Even then the temperature outside the bed room was 33 degree which didn’t appear comfortable. I switched on the AC on 25 degree though your Didi objected it. In fact AC does not suit her. She likes natural air/weather only. Sometimes I overrule her. I think I do injustice to her.

 When we slept together, slowly and slowly we touched each other and kissed each other. These are the normal things to start with. It is but natural that once we be eyes to eyes, be face to face, be limbs to limbs, we very often get excited and go ahead for intercourse.

 While … ?… in sex depth, your Didi surprised me by putting a question , ‘ Didn’t you ask Shweta how she felt during the period of intercourse ?’I said to her , ‘ I asked her but she only smiled & kissed me again and again as a token of acceptance of immense pleasure she felt while in intercourse . Sorry to say whereas you turned your neck slightly right, closed your eyes for a moment and covered your face a little bit with your palm . If you don’t mind, here is the difference between you and Shweta. Don’t you want to know what she replied ? She replied , ‘ It is due to the culture & tradition we were born and brought up differently. Have I ever kissed you during the last 49 years of our marriage? Shweta kissed you time and again whenever and wherever she… but truly speaking I hate to do so as my conscience doesn’t allow me? I don’t accuse her inasmuch as she is innocent as baby and secondly she doesn’t belong to modern age where kissing is a common affair. She added, ‘ I see, as you told me, Shweta doesn’t hesitate to kiss you even in public places whereas you know I don’t.’

 Your Didi, though rustic but is very practical. About romance and sex when I brought her after marriage at the first instance I apprehended she was dull and dreary, but to my utter surprise I found I was wrong, she was right. She opined sex is inherent in human body, it must not be provoked without a right cause, otherwise one’s health is badly affected. Romance, If I am not wrong, is nothing but rashness. One must keep oneself away from it physically as well as mentally as far as possible. Sometimes romance turns into insanity too and then beyond one’s control, may be brutal even on restriction or refusal.

 Shweta ! once I told you that in those days in joint family husband and wife were not allowed to sleep together – they slept separately – males with the males and females with females. They met together when all fell asleep in/after midnight. But now with the pace of time and development in science & technology immensely the world has shrunk and the people have come closer to each other. The culture and tradition of one country is affected quickly by that of the other. Now family means husband, wife and their children, even parents are ignored. When I was in metro cities I noticed the ladies wearing jeans and kameej/shirts instead of saris and blouses, young girls too , even without dupatta /ordhni. A new era of fashion has started everywhere and none is unaffected.

 Shweta ! our joy knew no bound when we hear from you that you are coming in Janmastami .

 When your Didi came to know about your arrival, her joy knew no bound. She is very anxious to see you. For the first time you will get together and happy to know each other. One day we will go to Parasnath where we will see Jain Temples – footprints of Lord Mahavir on top of the Parasnath hill. Next day we will visit Maithan Dam – a beautiful picnic spot. We will spend the night there in guest house and enjoy marginally together. It is a very calm & quit place – surrounded by natural beauty.

 It is now 1 AM and your Didi fell fast asleep. One thing is haunting in my mind when both of you would be here together. How I can justify myself in dealing with both of you at the same time on different occasions may be problematic a little bit for me. Let me judicious, only then I can prove to be a successful husband as well as lover. Isn’t it?

With due regards and love Lovingly Yours, Durga Prasad.
