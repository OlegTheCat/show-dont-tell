With the glimpse of hope in eyes , with the firmness of thought we all grow in the world of certainty. She was none the less different from others , she had dreams , hopes , and milestones to conquer.

I just flapped the cover and read the first page , 14 august 2013…he held my hand to promise to never leave me alone. I just slammed the book and tear rolled down my eye , I wanted to smash the dairy and throw it or bury it deep down somewhere in hell where he might be sitting flirting. The weather in itself was a punishment to me as I was growing old ….both physically and mentally. I grew old with respect to my hopes of finding some certainty I’m life.

“Anish but I really love u ” I said

 “but I can’t you are just friend to me…I don’t know what to say I am shocked” he said

 “ok .et it be bye hope to see you someday”

I left him with a hint of certainty that some day he will come back to me , in shear hope of unrequited love. After so much struggle I just touched the glory of love temple and now when I gathered some courage to visit it someone closed the door, but I kept waiting outside it stubborn to get inside it once. I struggled to do things which were not meant to be just in hope of there occurrence. May be someday god will pity me but he never did…

I just swiped my tears because i saw him coming. I kept the book where It was , he passed by me ignoring me…opened the dairy and started reading it. As always after reading it he stand in front of my photo and said “we were just friends yeah?…..but I loved you”…..
