Love Short Story – The Romeo Symptom

‘Saw her yesterday, didn’t you? You most probably won’t see her again. Before she threw the ball back down she told me we were lucky to have escaped the scolding because her aunt and uncle weren’t home’ said Gill, as he fell in beside me.

I turned to face him, seething in anger and jealousy. I guess my face must have given me away. ‘What? I’m just saying she doesn’t live here…’.

I walked off before he finished. I couldn’t decide which aspect wrenched at my heart the most. The fact that she didn’t live here or that she had talked to Gill.

 

I can’t focus because her smile is all that is emblazoned on my mind. I am picking at my dinner while I vaguely gather Mom telling Dad about Mrs. Verma’s visit.

Mom is going on about the evening and I am hanging onto every word, willing her, with every cell of my being, to bring up her name. But no such luck, the talk has passed on to other mundane details. As I reach for my second roti, I hear ‘..invitation for havan..’.

I hear the clock strike midnight. Sleep and rest are strangers to me now.
