You can call it as addiction..

Continuing with ” MONA”

ADDICTION seems like a big word but yes its yes, I’m addicted to her. Some reason might be there as i have yet not found a convincing reason.

 Coincidence may lead to convincing reason.

 Attachment was all that was found. Miscellaneous thoughts winded me up.

 Technically i was enchanted.

It was then when she called me up saying she is missing that stranger who was talking to her from last 8 days. As whole day her stranger was busy doing nothing. Some times you just need a reason to talk to a person.

Sudden things happens for reason and i got involved in it completely. Still complicated and i know if i ever meet her, I’ll surely fall for her. She became my thoughts and my thoughts were not in my control. A possible question came in my mind that ” how can a stranger be so important that a unknown girl is missing him? “. At some point i knew the answer but i wasn’t ready to accept it as it was completely a thing which almost can change my life.

When she became close to me in such a way I decided to tell her that now she has become my addiction. Or maybe its just attraction. But I at point I also started missing her. Emptiness was all in me which was going partially.

I found a sense of attachment for her in me. Days went on, we started talking on calls. Then she became my day maker. Whenever things use to happen i use to thing what she must have done and then i take my decisions.

Cluster of things happened but there was no sort of sense in it. Full day was not enough to describe the needful. Maybe she became the sense i always wanted to find. It was like a day was incomplete without talking to her.
