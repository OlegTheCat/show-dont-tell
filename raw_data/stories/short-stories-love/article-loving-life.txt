I love you.. These three words are used for showing their love towards many things may be human being, animals, nature etc.,

I love You dad. DAD = Daring and Dashing, Hero of my life, no fear with him, safe in his hands, friend of all my friends, teaches about experiences, shows the scope of living life.

I Love you mom. MOM= Mad On Me, Life of mine, best listener, ever loving than others, no preferences, heart beats for child not more than that, first to see me, ends with our happiness only.

I Love you… Simple to hear but its a big thing in life.  It holds the life to success or lashes away from every thing.  Just be aware of love and life.  Our life is made by our parents, we learn loving from them, but for that love with an girl may loose our great teachers of loving life.

Everything is possible in love to lead full life or to end life.. best option is upto our end.

Our parent’s love towards us is like a mirror, we may try to break it but it will be appeared in each piece of mirror until end.

Every thing may be changed, but love towards children never changes, never differs. We are glad to be in human life that we can express love towards many things.

So JUST LOVE LIFE… HAPPY TO HAVE OUR PARENTS AS LOVING ONE.. THEY ARE THE ONLY HEAVEN TO THE LIFE OF HAPPY.. JUST LISTEN TO HEART BEATS OF OUR PARENTS, IT IS ENOUGH TO REACH YOUR SUCCESS, GOALS, ACHIEVEMENTS ETC.,

Thanks to My God and Goddess for bearing a lot for bringing me to this wonderful world of heaven where I can see real happiness starts and ends with your happiness without any boarders.
