 from 

Forgive me…

of not seeing you,

of leaving you,

of forsaking you,

of not loving you.

 

Forgive me…

of hating you,

of making you cry,

of beating you,

of suppressing you.

 

Forgive me…

of not taking care of you,

of being not there beside you,

of talking behind your back,

of persuading you to throw me away.

 

Forgive me…

of taking you for granted,

of taking advantage of you,

of showing coldness to you,

of hurting you.

 

Forgive me…

of being worthless,

of being tactless,

of being careless,

of being emotionless.

 

Forgive me…

of being arrogant,

of being stupid,

of being indifferent,

of being timid.

 

Don’t value me!

Stay away from me!

Leave me alone!

I don’t love you anymore!

Forgive me…

 

 

Forgive me of saying…

I am strong.

I am vulnerable.

I am passionate.

I am lovable.

 

I don’t want you to know.

I don’t want you to discover.

I don’t want you to learn.

I want you to ignore me.

Forgive me of being stubborn.

 

I am weak and I am changing.

I am sick and I am crying.

I am lonely and I am leaving.

I am losing breath and I’m dying.

Forgive me… my love…

 

I’d rather be alone than see you in pain.

I’d rather cry alone than being with me.

I’d rather suffer alone than making you weak.

I’d rather die alone than leaving you in vain.

Forgive me…

 

Forgive me… is the last thing I want to say.

Forgive me… is the last words I want to convey.

Forgive me… is the last expression I want to tell.

Forgive me… is the last phrase I want to reveal.

 

I may be out in this world, but I have you.

I may be dead in this life, but I thank you.

I may no longer exist, but my heart is within you.

I may be entirely lifeless, but deep inside I love you.

Forgive me of leaving you; I just love you..
