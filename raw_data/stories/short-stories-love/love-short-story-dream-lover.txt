Rohan is a smart guy, a engineer with handsome salary. Considered to be most eligible bachelor among relatives.. His parents were all set to arrange for his wedding. Rohan has many dreams about his life partner. He wished to marry a beautiful and educated girl..

 But his parents arranged his wedding with a sanskari girl Roopa who happened to be his distant relative. Girl was neither beautiful nor educated, But to mention the girl with a beautiful soul. No one bothered about opinion of Rohan. Wedding just happened. Rohan hated Roopa. Never accepted her as his wife. The lady won hearts of all family members except Rohan. she waited patiently.

Many years passed, now Roopa begin falling sick out of depression. Within these years a beautiful lady came in the dreams of Rohan.. He fell in love with her… He started sleeping more and more to dream and to do romance with the lady..

 Meanwhile Roopas health was worsened but Rohan never cared about her. She was too ill. Even though other family members took care of her she did not recover.

 One day the lover in the dreams of Rohan did not show her face to him. She turned back. Rohan pleaded her to turn to him and show her face. The lady denied and said its her time to leave. Now Rohan asked who are you and you want to leave?

 The beautiful lady replied i am none other than soul of Roopa. And you will come to know why left by tomorrow morning.

 Rohan realised he should have respected Roopas goodness instead of giving much importance to external beauty.

 Next morning he immediately went to Roopa to apologise.. But Roopa never woke up..

 Her soul has left her!!!!
