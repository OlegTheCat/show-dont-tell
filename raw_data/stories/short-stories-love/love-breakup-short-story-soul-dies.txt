“Please don’t leave me baby! I beg you please! I just love you dear and can’t live without you” she cried..

“Go to hell. Do whatever you want. Die or live. I don’t care about you moron” He disconnect the call.

This was the hundredth times when she was begging to save her relation. Four months before her boyfriend broke up with her. Since then her daily routine was just to call him ,messaging him and crying for him.

Today she remembered the starting of their relation. It was beautiful, more beautiful than her dreams!

But that was past. Long distance told everything which was hidden. That relation based only on lust for him. So it ended finally. She don’t understand what was her fault? Loving him or believing him!!

But today his words visualises her the truth. Self-respect matters more than love .

She have to move on and she decided to be alive. Yet she knows deeply inside somewhere her soul was already died!!!
