The wait which once was a desperation to see you has now become eternal. Every night I sit, drooping under the moonlight, searching the answers of the unanswered questions. I keep questioning myself, “where are you?”, “how could you leave me alone?” though my heart knows you are never going to return yet it waits, it waits to dance on the beats of your heartbeat, sing along,to hold your hand and to be lost.

The clock struck 2  and I sit awake, with a cup full of strong coffee. Little do I know that not even a strong aromatic coffee could help me get over the hangover of your love. Amidst the bright, twinkling stars that reminds me of your gracious beam, the warmth of the cozy blanket makes feel your presence I sit and reread the last letter that I wrote for you.

I know 

 

And with the last words of this letter i put myself to sleep and hope to wake up in your arms.

–END–
