Creative Writing – Love Letter Contest 2013

Love letters played their role since ages in all the love stories. In Early ages love letters were written with brush on piece of cloth and sent by pigeon. Ages changed and love letters were now being written on papers with pens and sent by postal services. Now is the age when love letters are written in the form of SMS or emails.

Nishi is an independent and confident woman working in an MNC in New Delhi. Her love story started in her office when she was sent in an American Client team to work under Varun. Varun was a senior Manager in that team who worked out of USA. He used to communicate with his team by emails and Cisco phones. Nishi used to talk to him numerous times in a day about work, but they never talked to each other about anything else.

That day Nishi was sitting in her flat near the window chatting with her friends on Facebook. Then comes a friend request from Varun, she was surprised, she clicked on “Accept” to accept his friend request. Now started the chat orders between the two of them which became a habit eventually to chat with each other after reaching home from office irrespective of how tired they were and the time difference between the two countries.

Varun: “Hi, Reached home?”

 Nishi: Yep just had breakfast. What about you? How was the day?

 Varun: Day was good and hectic as always. M havin my dinner.

 Nishi: Okays

 Nishi: I hope your girlfriend don’t mind you talking to me ;)

 Varun: I told you I don’t have any

 Varun: Anyways I am coming to India. Finally will get a chance to see you.

 Nishi: You didnt saw me in my pics??? Shoot… I posted those pics only for you my Edward… ;)

 (Edward and Bella are the character from famous book and movie Twilight)

 Varun: I mean will see you in-person. I cant be your Edward as you haven’t proposed me yet.

 Nishi: Excuse me I am a girl and in India girls don’t propose. don’t you know Mr. America???

 Varun: Hah that’s old story now girls take the charge. Come on I am waiting.

 Nishi: Get Lost, keep waiting ;)

 Varun: Talking to your senior like that, you don’t love your job I guess.

 Nishi: No I love only my Edward… ;)

 Varun: Lol

 Nishi: M feelin sleepy..

 Varun: Ok go sleep then.

 Nishi: Bye tc gn

 Varun: Gn Tc

Then came the time when varun came to New Delhi and both of them met in the office for the first time. They didn’t talk about anything else apart from work as usual. After reaching home Nishi went staraight to her laptop to chat with Varun.

 Nishi: Hi

 Varun: Hi, Wow so desperate to talk to me…. ;)

 Nishi: Haha very funny

 Nishi: Listen its Saturday, I am going for a movie with a friend today you want to join?

 Varun: Yes ofcourse, its been a while I saw any Bollywood movie.

 Nishi: Fine see you then at 8:00 PM near Natraj Cinema.

They used to spend almost every weekend together, both of them have sensed their feelings for each other but nobody proposed. 4 months flew just like that and the day arrived when Varun had to leave for USA. After Varun Left, Nishi thought about sharing her feelings with Varun, so she wrote an email.

 

Nishi was about to click the send button when she got a chat message from Varun, she got busy in replying to him and forgot to click Send. The letter got saved into drafts. Next day when Nishi opened the letter again to send it to Varun, She got an email from Varun with a biodata of a girl and photograph in it. This was the girl whose proposal had come to Varun’s parents for her and Varun’s marriage. Varun asked Nishi to take a look at the photo and Biodata and give her advice. Nishi couldn’t breathe, she felt chocked for a moment. She realized that she had tears in her eyes, she wiped them out and replied to Varun’s email after looking at the photograph and biodata.

Nishi: Nice girl, looks beautiful and simple. Go for it.

 Varun: Huh what go for it, Did you see her education? She wont be working, she wont be even able to teach my kids or handle herself on her own here in USA.

 Nishi: hmmmmm then look for other girls, I am sure Aunty Uncle will be receiving a lot of proposals.

 Varun: Yes they are but I am not interested in them, Now I ask you Can you talk to your parents about us so we can get married?

Nishi was surprised and happy with this question. She felt as if she got her life back.

Nishi: What? ummmmm okay let me talk to Mom first. You don’t say anything at your place until I tell you to.

 Varun: Alright.

Nishi talked to her Mom Mrs. Vrunda Sharma about Varun that evening. Her Mom was little worried as Varun was from other religion and it will be difficult for Nishi to accept a totally new religion and follow it. She was sure that Varun and Nishi wouldn’t have talked about it. She decided to meet Varun’s Parents and talk to them face to face about this. She came to visit Nishi for a week the next month and visited Varun’s home. She talked with Varun’s parents about almost everything thing on earth but not Nishi and Varun’s marriage. Nishi didn’t understand why her mother did not talked to Varun’s parents. Mrs. Vrunda had a lot of good and bad experiences in her life and she did not want to take the biggest decision of her daughter’s life in a hurry.

Its been a month since Mrs. Vrunda visited Nishi, she hasn’t made up her mind yet and Mr. SHarma also didn’t say a word. Nishi and Varun were tensed that what if they don’t agree. Nishi used to try to talk to her Mom every week about Varun but her mother used to change the topic. Its been around three months and now Varun also started getting impatient. Nishi decided to visit her parents to talk to them firmly. She took a week off from office and took the first train to her hometown. On the noon of second day of her arrival, she tried to talk to her mother about Varun.

 Nishi: Mom, Varun’s mother was asking him about your decision.

 Mrs. Vrunda: Hmmmm Okay. I don’t know what to answer as I haven’t made up my mind yet.

 Nishi: Then tell them that you are not ready for this relationship or if you cant do it I can tell them.

 Mrs. Vrunda: I want to talk to Varun. Its really difficult to get you married to a guy whom we haven’t even seen.

 Nishi: Okay let me arrange a Skype call with him so you can see and talk to him.

Nishi dialed Varun from Skype. She told Varun already that her mother will be talking to him.

 Varun: Hello Aunty. How are you?

 Mrs. Vrunda: Hello Varun Beta. We all are fine, you say.

 Varun: I am fine too Aunty. Nishi told me you wanted to talk to me.

 Mrs. Vrunda: Yes I wanted to ask you a few questions. I hope you understand how difficult it is for a girl’s parents to make such a decision when they didn’t even see the guy.

 Varun: Sure Aunty I understand, I too have a sister.

 Mrs. Vrunda: I wanted to know about your future plan Son.

 Varun: I am planning to stay for at least next 5 years in USA only in my current job. But if Nishi wont like it here then probably we will return to India.

 Mrs. Vrunda: When are you planning to come to India to meet us?

 Varun: It will be possible for me to come in next year only Aunty around January.

 Mrs. Vrunda: Okay Son, I will talk to Nishi’s father and we will talk to your parents too.

Nishi and Varun both were having butterflies in their stomachs and wanted to talk each other so both can feel better. But they didn’t as Nishi preferred not to talk to Varun in front of her parents since she talked about marriage. Nishi lived there five more days but nobody in the family talked to her about Varun. She came back hoping that her parents didn’t like Varun.

After a month her parents and younger sister were coming to visit her and they all were going on a small vacation. Nishi went to receive all of them at the Railway Station. She dropped them home and rushed back to her office. In the morning when Nishi came, her mother made her breakfast and told her to rest after a while. Nishi and her sister talked for a while and then she went to sleep.

The next morning when Nishi returned from the Office, her flat mate Kanika congratulated her.

Kanika: Congrats Nishu, I am so happy for you.

 Nishi: Happy about what? Why are you congratulating me?

 Kanika: Oh you don’t know??????

 Nishi: What I don’t know?

 Kanika: Aunty told me something which made me happy.

 Nishi: Come on will someone tell me what is going on?

 Kanika: You and Varun are getting married you Dumbo. Congrats

 Nishi: What???

 Kanika: Yes Aunty and Uncle went to Varun’s house yesterday when you were sleeping.

 Nishi: Then why didn’t they tell me?? I thought they didn’t like Varun.

 Mrs. Varun: Its not so easy to take such difficult decisions. Of course we needed time to think and decide. His family is really good and we liked them. We haven’t decided the wedding date yet but will decide over the phone soon.

Nishi couldn’t believe her ears, she wanted to jump, to dance, to sing… but she controlled herself and tried to act calm.

Its been two months after Nishi and Varun’s Marriage and Varun was leaving for USA. Varun was on Airport when Nishi called him.

 Nishi: Hello

 Varun: Hey dear Wife. I have already started missing you.

 Nishi: Same here. Check your laptop bag front pocket. There is something for you.

 Varun checked it, he found a letter.

The letter Nishi wrote in an email to tell Varun about her feelings was modified and finally reached him.
