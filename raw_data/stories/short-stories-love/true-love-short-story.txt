TRUE LOVE … – Short Story

Photo credit: 

 from 

It was 6 a.m in the morning during winter in Delhi .I was in sound sleep.

It was so cold that I wrapped myself up between two mattresses to feel warmth.

Sometimes I get these innovative ideas of using things in a different way.

I mean who sleeps between two heavy mattresses that too with a cell phone under the pillow.

It has become almost impossible for me to live without my cellphone which I use it to chat with my facebook friends.

My cellphone alarm started ringing when I was dreaming about a beautiful girl that I had seen on facebook last night.

I tried my best to stop it but i could not find it under my pillow. After 5 minutes of agonising search i found it inside the pillow cover..God knows how it managed to get there.

I don’t even brush my teeth without checking my facebook account on my phone.

I started getting ready to college thinking about the girl on facebook.

THE GIRL that makes my heart beat faster than usual.Let me tell you about the girl on facebook .

Frankly speaking she is not a complete stranger to me. We know each other since 8 years.

YES! 8 LONG YEARS..

EMPHASIS ON 8..WHY?

bcoz

I was in love with her since 8 years . Her name is pooja…I remember the day when i saw her for the first time..She looked like kangana ranaut with glasses.

We were lab partners during 1st year. She asked my name .

I wanted to tell my name in james bond style…

like bond…. james bond

but i could not because

my name is duvvuri venkata ganga kumar swamy

Can you imagine how weird it would have sounded in james bond style. I told her my name is venkat.

That was the first time i told my name to a girl..that too to a beautiful girl like pooja..I felt like tom cruise for a moment.

I was 17 then but sometimes i behaved like a 9 year old. It was lunch break after the lab.While most of my friends were busy in impressing their girl lab partners i was busy eating junk food.

One fine day pooja asked me out for dinner but i said no because i did not want my seniors to know about her.

Ragging was on full swing during first year..my seniors made me do all sort of things that iam not supposed to do…after 8 months of ragging we were finally set free by our seniors…

We entered 2nd year. we became seniors. pooja was getting a lot of attention in college because of her charismatic attitude. I was a nobody in college..

most of the people know me only as her lab partner..not my actual name..it was sort of identity crisis for me..

Behind every man there is a woman similarly behind every famous idiot there is a girl. I think this holds true to me..

I became famous during 1st year because pooja used to talk alot about me in girls hostel…

Pooja was busy with her new friends while i was busy knowing my juniors from my place.

After some time during 2nd year i started to feel something for her. i did not tell her anything about it.But i grew possessive about her. i told her not to talk with other boys because that mekes me feel jealous.

After that she stopped talking to me. She started talking to each and every boy in college intentionally to make me jealous. I am sure she enjoyed watching my face turn red when she was talking to other boys.

I was immature and not at all good in expressing my feelings…especially when it comes to girls.

I was roaming like a lost soul in college and acting weird infront of pooja…so pooja got suspicious of my behaviour and asked me whether i was loving her…

OUR conversation went like this

POOJA: DO YOU LOVE ME?

ME: YES. I THINK IAM CRAZY ABOUT YOU (with a smile on my face)

POOJA: ITS YOUR FAULT

ME: OH REALLY..IAM NOT ABLE TO CONCENTRATE ON MY STUDIES BECAUSE OF YOU ..ITS YOUR FAULT..

POOJA: CONCENTRATE ON YOUR STUDIES ..AND DONT BLAME ME FOR EVERTHING

After some days pooja wrote a testimonial in orkut for a guy in our class .

His name is alok andhe looks better than me and also very intelligent.

I wanted to kill him.

POOJA BLOCKED ME IN ORKUT AND WROTE A TESTIMONIAL TO SOMEONE ELSE APPRECIATING HIM…I FELT LIKE A LOOSER…

I became devdas and i started quoting idiotic phrases like

BEHIND EVERY UNSUCCESSFULL MAN THERE IS A WOMAN…

PYAAR KIYA THO PADNA KYA….( My grades are reaching rock bottom).

During final year we had a big fight and she said she will file an FIR against me..and the next day she saw me and laughed.

Its very difficult to understand women. When i did something very serious and stupid she does not react at all..but when i gave her a miss call she wanted to file an FIR…

Oh GOD..women are really complicated..

Its been 4 years since our college is over but i still miss her…

Recently i sent her a friend request in facebook but there is no response from her..

.i even messsaged my number to her in facebook hoping that she will call me one day…

FACEBOOK AND CELLPHONE …THESE ARE MY ONLY HOPE TO REGAIN CONTACT WITH HER..

ITS VERY EASY TO LOVE SOMEONE THAT LOVES YOU….

BUT IT TAKES TRUE LOVE TO LOVE SOMEONE IF THEY DO NOT LOVE YOU…

TRUE LOVE TRIUMPHS…

TRUE LOVE LEADS TO MATURITY,PATIENCE AND BALANCE IN EMOTIONS..

DON’T YOU THINK IT IS TRUE LOVE THAT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER EVEN IF POOJA DOESNT LOVE ME..

TRUE LOVE LEADS TO FREEDOM

IF YOU REALLY LOVE SOMEONE SET THEM FREE ..THEY WILL COME TO YOU ONE DAY.

Guys let me tell you something ..its not that easy to forget someone you loved for the first time..

Statements like “AAJ POOJA KAL KOI DHOOJA” are not really easy to implement.But rejection is necessary to gain maturity.

As time progresses we learn to deal things with maturity..but with maturity comes some dissatisfaction because maturity in our thoughts helps us to realize the difference between what is real and what is not.
