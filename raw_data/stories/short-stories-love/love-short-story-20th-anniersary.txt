Creative Writing – Love Letter Contest 2013

(A husband and a wife are sleeping on roof of their house with their arms in arms. Sun is rising up. Cool breeze is blowing. Chirruping of birds makes husband stirs and finally, he wakes up and remembers he is on roof of his house with his wife.)

It’s morning and my dear wify is still sleeping. It is so good to look at sky while lying. I must say that it was her idea of sleeping here as it was peaceful to sleep with blanket of stars over us and even now it is very soothing. And I, as always, loved her idea because I know she loves star gazing, the way she imagines the forms out of clouds, gets excited every time she finds one and I love watching her when she does that. I can see golden sun rays falling on her face making her skin glow and she is looking more beautiful now.

“

.”

Wait a second! Oh hell, how could I forget this day? I never imagined I could be so deeply and madly in love with her that I would forget this important date. I hope she has not planned anything big to celebrate these last 20 years. I should think of something. What could be done…

 I can give flowers but we keep giving flowers on any day we feel like.

I can prepare today’s breakfast but I did that for her on last valentine.

Songs…? I am already done with making a video for her on our 1st anniversary.

Cake, greetings…? All done. What is left? Well, I am short of ideas now as I have used every single idea of mine in last 20 years.

Oh! She is getting up. Act normal. Don’t let her know today is something important. Oh…she herself must be remembering.

“

”

Oh, I love your smile. Every day when I see you smile, I fall for you all over again.

“

(I hope she does not remember.)

“

“

”

I am hoping she does not have any surprise planned for today. How can I forget this day? What should I do? Should I take a leave today? But what will I do after that? I have not done any preparation and she does not like going out and spend time. She won’t let me enter kitchen now. Oh god! Please help me…

Idea! I will follow a normal routine. After reaching office, I will take half day leave and in the meantime, I will jot down my feelings in a love letter for her remembering last 20 years of us.  Then, will keep this letter on her table addressed to myself so that when she will see, she will come to me and I will ask her to read. Yes, that way I can see every expression on her face. Yes, that way I can see smile on her face. I might get caught. She knows my handwriting. I can ask someone from my office to write my name on that envelope. Yes, this sounds to be a plan. I can add details into it.

“

After next 20 minutes, I am sitting on dining table, done with breakfast and still hoping there won’t be any surprises.

Now, all I need to do is write a letter. What can be written? Let me think.

Oh god! Why I am not good as her at writing down what I am feeling.

I can do it. Think good and good will follow. Let’s start.

“Dear Love,

It has been 20 years now since we had decided to spend the rest of our lives with each other and I am sure we’ll be with each other till the end of the time (Of ‘course, I am not challenging God) but despite this long time, the day when I made you mine is still fresh in my memory. It seems like last night that led me to say it aloud to you that I Love You. I don’t know what happened to me that time when we disconnected that particular call. But whatever that was, that particular feeling made me realize, “Yes! I am complete today”.

From that very moment I had started calling you my love in my mind and it was really very hard for me to restrict myself from telling you this. Next day when I met you, my perception towards you had changed. Now, you were my friend and my lover. I had realized that you also wanted the same when you had shared your feelings with me a month back and now it was happening from both sides. You had no idea that my feelings had changed and how I was feeling when I was with you. I controlled myself hard from telling you what I was feeling as I wanted to keep it for your birthday that happens to fall next month. Only I knew how I managed myself for 2 days but on the third day it all got out of my hands when I sat next to you. I was just looking at your hands and I wanted to hold them, wanted to feel them, wanted to feel the warmth of your touch and for that all I had to do was to make you mine by telling you how I had started feeling for you and how I had fallen for you. I must not forget to say that crave to hold your hands was the main source that led to my explosion otherwise I would have delayed it till your birthday. But, I thank God for letting that happen, thank You God for making me crave otherwise I wouldn’t have tried.

I knew that it was all formality when you asked for some time to think but then, when I held your hand, I felt something completely different. It had never happened to me before. Although all I did was to hold your hand but the impact was direct on my heart. It was comforting, relieving and it was some kind of happiness that was alien in nature, it was the feeling that was making me feel complete. I never knew that single human touch could make me feel this much soothing and that was all happening to me right in front of my eyes at that very moment. The way we looked into each other’s eyes was another best thing happened that day. Although, our eyes met for a very brief moment but that was like for million years. I was much more than satisfied by holding your hand and kept it holding as long as I could and then on the way back to home when you replied me “I Love You Too”, my world went upside down with immense happiness. I didn’t know what to reply so I smiled briefly and we kept moving. After calling it a day, a beautiful day to be precise and bidding you Goodbye with a promise to meet again, I returned back to my nest and so did you. Even when I was returning alone, I was very happy and all I wanted was to see you again as soon as possible and spend some time with you.”

(Mobile phone rings.)

It must be my wife checking on me. I told you (looking at mobile).

“

(Please god, she does not remember.)

”

That was close. Now let’s continue with letter. Where was I?

After college got over our distances never meant that we were far. Our love and my frequent visits to meet you helped us keep our sanity. But as the time moved on, we grew restless and God helped us a lot. I must say that God really helped us a lot in providing us all we wanted at the right time and in a right manner.

Next thing I could think of days when I was trying too hard to get a government job but things were not in our favour. We both were waiting eagerly so that we could take things to next level by talking to your parents about my proposal to make you mine. It was the most crucial thing that turned into milestone for me and was getting tougher day by day to cross. But finally after lot of struggle and with all the blessings of our elders and dear God, I got the job. It was one of the best days of my life.

And now the next step was to give some pace to our relation that was on halt from long time by talking to your parents to take my proposal into their consideration. So, on a bright sunny day I decided to go and talk. I reached at your place with a strange happiness on my face. Your dad wasn’t home as he was in his office in some other city. I was all nervous at that moment and my hands were shivering but thanks to God that was noticeable to me only.

Somehow I succeeded in starting some random conversation with your mom. I don’t why but I had qualms that your mom already knew why I was there. I was saying to myself “it’s Ok, everything will be in my favor; everything will be in my favor”…and suddenly I initiated the thing. I also asked you through my eyes to sit there with us to back me up. It was all going smooth like butter and in a moment I felt like some burden had gotten off me. Mum told me that she and dad would consider the situation. Next thing I could remember was we both got busy with preparations of our marriage and soon we were married to each other. Finally, I was your hubby and you were my wify.

After that every single day is memorable for me. Be it our honeymoon or birth of twins, I am thankful to you for all the happiness you gave to me.

I just love those little sweet things between us like keep turning to see each other till the last moment, looking for every single possibility to be with each other, saying I love you in the end of every single meeting, wishing you good night by calling you my wife every single night (even before marriage), your act of leaving some water for me every time we are alone, wishing each other monthly anniversary and so many more.

I just can’t believe it that God is really watching us and giving us each and every single thing that we want. I believe after all you are an Angel that’s why God is concerned about us.

At last, I love you my wife, will always love you, will never leave you and will always take care of you.

Happy Anniversary my Wife.

Lots of Love,

Nonu

This seems to look good. I can only hope that wify will also like it. What time is it? Oh! It’s already 12.30. What else to add with this letter? I should arrange for flowers. That always works on females. What else? U mm…should I buy another book for her? I can but that is not very exciting. I should take her out… No, she does not like going out. What to do, then? One thing can be done. Yes. I got it. Now I should reach home.

At home.

(Door bell rings.)

Wify has gone in kitchen. Now is the time. (Keeping envelope quietly on the study table)

A little later.

(Wife continues reading)

Oh my wify. I just love your smile. I got you baby. Oh, her expressions narrate whole story. She loved it. Thank you god for helping me out and for making her forgets this day. (After wife finishes reading with tearful eyes)

(Phone receives an image, same wallpaper that husband used to propose his wife 20 years back. Wife looks at it and then back to her husband.)

(giggling).
