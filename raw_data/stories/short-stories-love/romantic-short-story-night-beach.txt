Romantic Short Story – On The Night Beach

So he ate his food he cooked. He is now happy. There is no hunger. He only lives in his hut. So he locked the door, before he came out. He walked on the beach.  It is a night full of moon light. He likes full moon nights on the Beach.

He reached the Boat. He wants to launch it on water.

“Shall I help you?”

He looked turning back. She is there for his surprise. She is a young girl. May be sixteen or seventeen.

“How can you help me?”

“In many ways”

“Explain.”

“I can push the boat in to water. You can sail.”

“Then…”

“I can cook for you. I know you are alone.”

“So you know me. Who are you?”

“I am just a girl of sixteen.  I am looking for good time.”

“I am not good for any good time.”

“I know you lost your father and mother.”

“Everybody knows that.”

“You lost a job in government for a crime you did not do.”

“Well, well! You know much. So you know that I am a man of loss.”

“Yes”

“Why you are after a man of loss?”

“Because …”

“Because …”

The eyes of that young girl are full of tears. She is unable to say what she wants to say.

“What this because?”

He is feeling like his time is getting wasted. He has to go on sea to catch fish.

She is yet thinking. She is thinking to say the truth.

“You can say anything about this “because”, do you like to come with me on the boat?”

“Yes”

“You have to help me in fishing”

“I do”

“Do you have any experience?”

“None”

“Don’t worry. I will teach you.”

He took her on the Boat. The boat is full with love. Love is there between the two young.

Love is there between two adult thinking bodies.

He had her in his warm hug. She resisted as she did not want to have that.

In silence of the moon light on the sea, she is made a woman from the girl.

He is happy for having her.

He is unhappy for having her without her concern.

She lost her virginity without violence and without her consent.

Fishing is over.

He got more fish on that night.

She is silent most of the night while fishing, but she helped him.

In the early morning they reached the shore.

The boat is locked on the shore.

He looked at her. She also looked at him.

“I am sorry for I have been harsh and Your virginity is lost by me.”

“…………..”

“You did not tell me about that ‘because’.”

“What to tell?”

“Why?”

“All the men are alike.”

“What do you mean by?”

“I lost twice”

“What?”

“Virginity”

‘Oh. I am extremely sorry.”

“I am one like you in govt. job. You lost job for a crime you did not do. So I wanted to come to you to support. Meanwhile… “

She stopped for a while. Then she continued.

“I am a victim of a group of drunkard on this beach. I lost my virginity. I cannot say that to attract more criminals to my side. I came to explain you about this and request you to let me live with you. I did not expect that you too…”

“I am really sorry.”

“I know you say that.”

“Not for what I did, but for what happened to you.”

She looked at him. There is silence in the early morning sunlight.

“You are my wife.”

He took her in to his warm hug. She got the feeling. That is the feeling of security and love to his character.
