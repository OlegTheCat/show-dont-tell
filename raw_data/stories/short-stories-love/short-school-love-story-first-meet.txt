The loveliest four hours of observation with prolong breaks were over and the class was dismissed.

My friends were gaping at the class schedule before they leave. Progressively she came, and tried to glance at the chart. In my vision , it was hard for her to read the texts cause my friends had covered the main part.

 Anyhow she managed to get the required info and then she left through the stairs.

During the whole procedure I was staring at her … Its not new and I’m sure that by this time she can understand my weird way of looking at her. Only I could have removed my friends off the notice Board…. But her Eternal beauty and divinity ceased my soul.

OMG

What should I do…My friends would stop here for a couple of minutes or so..What if she escapes the staircase before I ask her name today?

 I cannot lose the day this way…

दोस्तों से तो रोज़ मिलते हें आज एक रोज़ से मिल आते ह…

Through the stairs I ran to get close to her. It was the last 10th of the stairs…. To her ears I whispered, “EXCUSE ME what’s your name?”

She turned  softly ,gaped at me and said her name just the was her name is.

Let her name remain a secret.

After gifting me the gift of the day she continued walking and reached the last stair.

Grinning and pointing to myself “Wont you ask my name”

“Yeah Say!” Her eyes were wide open having a straight face and a little of hurry.

With ultimate pleasure I replied to my own question “Sarthak”.

The conversation ended with whistles and squeaks which my classmates made leaning down the stairs. Thanks to the almighty she had already left the staircase by then.
