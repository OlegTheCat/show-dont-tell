LLC01: Love Letter to Husband/ Wife

Creative Writing – Love Letter Contest 2013

© YourStoryClub.com

I am Sagar 40 years of age and I still remember how I met my wife, Jenny. I was never looking for a superwoman or a miss perfect but someone who would love me the way I am and also love Sammy. Sammy was my best buddy, my best friend, a friend in need, someone who listens to me without any questions, plays with me; he is my companion and also a friend. He was my dog who would wait for me to return in the evening at the gate and jump over me; lick me all over and that is how he expressed his love towards me.

Every morning Sammy and I use to go for a walk in the park and there we would play the game ‘fetch the ball’. Sammy was always excited to go to the park well after all he got to run around in an area of approximately 6500 square feet whereas my house would be somewhere around 700 square feet. Sammy was 5 years old that time and I still remember the first day when I had seen him a small black puppy crying softly on the streets. Earlier I would just go around give him some food and play with him but soon I decided to adopt him and then he became an important member of my life.

That day also Sammy and I had gone for a walk where I saw a new face in the park. A girl with shinning straight long black hair wearing a blue t-shirt with grey track pants. I have no idea why I had been looking at her constantly but I guess Sammy noticed me watching her and he barked to bring my attention back to him.

I: “Oh yes Sammy boy here go fetch the ball.” Saying this I threw the ball and Sammy goes back to fetch the ball.

Again my attention diverted towards this new girl; she was bending down touching her feet and getting up. Definitely that is a usual sight in the park; most people in the park do this every day but I had no idea why constantly my mind is getting diverted to her. Sammy was back with the ball and wanted me to throw it again. I threw the ball again and he fetches it back and repeated this for several times. After sometime Sammy started walking towards the girl instead of walking towards the ball; I had no idea what is on Sammy’s mind and I was watching him intently trying to figure out what he was upto. He went near to the girl and I saw her bend down rub her hand over his hear and say something and before I could go near to listen to the conversation Sammy was returning back. I was happy to see that she loves dogs but I was sad that I wasn’t Sammy who could feel the girl’s hand. Sammy was holding a handkerchief in his mouth and it seemed that she had given it to him.

I: “Sammy boy this is not good you should not have taken the handkerchief. Now let me go and return it to her.”

I took the handkerchief from his mouth and when I decided to return it back she had already left. I thought I would return it next day and I saw her surrounded with a group of women. Suddenly I felt uneasy to approach her but I had to return her handkerchief but I did not even know where she lived. Finally I decided I would seek help from Sammy and return back this handkerchief.

I: “Sammy boy you have to return this handkerchief to that girl. Oh wait let me write a sorry note to her before you go and return this to her.”

Hello,

I am Sagar and this is my dog Sammy. I am sorry that he took your handkerchief. Please take it back and even Sammy is very sorry for this.

Yours truly,

Sagar.

 

I tied the letter around Sammy’s dog collar and asked him to return the handkerchief along with the letter. By the time Sammy started walking she had already left but Sammy still kept running and I was not sure where was he going; I also started running behind him on the way few dogs barked at him but it seemed that he wasn’t bothered about them. He was too fast and I could not catch up with him. From a distance I saw him running towards a house and as I approached towards the house I saw the same girl. She was at the door saying something to Sammy and I could see her take the handkerchief and letter from the collar. She went inside and again came back after sometime and tied a letter on his collar. I was watching everything from a distance. Sammy came back running to me and that was the first time she was looking at me. She gave a smile and I also smiled back. I took the letter from Sammy’s collar and started reading it.

Hello Sagar,

Your dog is really very cute and I love his name Sammy. I had gifted him the handkerchief but if you want to return it; its fine I have no issues.

Yours truly,

Jenny.

 

I: “Sammy boy the girl’s name is Jenny. Thanks because of you I got to know her name. Today you will get your favorite piece in the meal.”

After this it became a habit and we started exchanging letters and Sammy became our messenger of love.

Hello Jenny,

You have a lovely name; a beautiful smile and a glowing skin. It glows more when the sun rays softly fall on your skin. And when your black hair flows in the wind they make a beautiful wave.

Yours truly,

Sagar.

 

To this Jenny replied:

Hello Sagar,

You really know how to compliment a girl in an impressive way. But sadly I am not that good with giving compliments. I can only say that you must be good at heart.

Yours truly,

Jenny.

 

Every day I would give one letter to Jenny and receive one letter from her. Sammy also seemed to enjoy his new job as a messenger.

Hello Jenny,

Don’t worry just keep reading my letters and even you will learn the art of giving compliments. Your start is already good with giving compliments.

Yours truly,

Sagar.

 

Hello Sagar,

So you teach people about giving compliments? I wonder what kind of a job you do.

Yours truly,

Jenny.

 

I would read the letter and talk to Sammy; he would usually have a blank face but still his ears would listen to me with all alertness and attention.

I: “Sammy boy the girl wants to know about my job. What do you think do we have a future together?”

Sammy barked out loud and shook his head as if saying yes.

I: “Sammy boy you like her? Don’t you? So is she perfect for your Bhabhi?”

Sammy again barked and shook his head in yes. Somehow I felt good that Sammy had approved of Jenny and now even I wanted her to be my wife. I wrote a letter telling her what I do and tied it around Sammy’s neck. He knew his job well and took the letter to Jenny.

Hello Jenny,

My job is to make a disastrous place look beautiful. I am an architect who has designed many houses and my clients feel they are beautiful. Someday I want to design a house for myself where my wife, kids, and Sammy would stay with me.

And if I may ask what is your profession.

Yours truly,

Sagar.

 

Jenny replied back to the letter.

Hello Sagar,

I am sure the house which you will design for yourself is really going to be special. As for my job I also make disastrous things look beautiful but the only difference is that I am a beautician. I work in the nearby parlor. I recently completed my studies and then work brought me to this city. I hope my clients also feel that I have done a good job for them and made them look appealing infront of their loved ones.

Yours truly,

Jenny.

 

I read her letter and as usual it was time to talk to Sammy.

I: “Sammy boy she is a beautician and I am sure she would be having the Midas touch. See you have also started looking beautiful since the day she has started touching you.”

Sammy woofed at me as if saying I was always beautiful.

I: “Yeah yeah you were always my beautiful little thing.” I rubbed his chest and he lay on his back to get a good massage on his chest; I kept rubbing him and thinking about Jenny. We would see each other in the park and pass a smile at each other; sometimes we would even exchange hi-hellos. We would converse more with letters and we started getting to know each other better with letters. Except Sammy no one knew I was exchanging letters with a girl; somehow I was not comfortable sharing this with my friend as I felt they would make fun of me. It was time to write a letter to Jenny.

Hello Jenny,

Do you find it weird that every day I keep writing letters to you in the age of email, phone numbers, instant messages, and chats?

Yours truly,

Sagar.

 

Jenny replied to the letter:

Hello Sagar,

Let me confess one thing I am not really a very technology savvy girl. I find handwritten letter more personal. I have cherished every letter sent by you. Every day I keep waiting for your letter and it has become a ritual to read your letter. I don’t know if you will believe me or not but I still letters to my grandparents.

Yours truly,

Sagar.

 

Sagar was happy to know she loved reading his handwritten letters and even he had cherished all her letters.

I: “Sammy boy if you were not there how would I come across all these beautiful letters sent by Jenny. You know she has cherished all my letters just like I have cherished her letters.”

Sammy woofed and expected a massage for his good work. I rubbed his chest and he enjoyed it.

Hello Jenny,

It was lovely to know that you have cherished my letters. Even I have cherished your letter. Also do keep writing to your grandparents I am sure they would be waiting for your letter eagerly.

Yours truly,

Sagar.

 

Jenny replied to the letter

Hello Sagar,

These letters are my companion in the free time. I read your letters repeatedly until I don’t fall asleep. With your letter I feel there is someone near me.

Yours truly,

Jenny.

 

To which I replied.

Hello Jenny,

I am sure you would be missing your family a lot. I am happy to know my letters give you company. Even I stay alone here and I can understand the difficulties which you face staying alone. Sammy has been my companion since 5 years and now I get company through your letters. Anytime if you want any help just let me know.

Yours truly,

Sagar

Jenny replied to the letter

Hello Sagar,

Actually I don’t stay alone here. I have a roommate but she is a weird lady. Only first day she had spoken to me when she asked me about my name, place, education, and job. After that day we stay in the same room but we have never spoken to each other. We both leave for work by 9 and I come back by 6. But she comes back usually late; I have never asked her the reason for this. Weekends also she usually stays outside and I am new to the city still trying to make friends. But I have found 2 really good friends in the city whom I can trust – you and Sammy.

Yours truly,

Jenny.

Next day we were roaming around in the park and as usual Jenny and I exchanged smiles. Suddenly Jenny slipped and it seemed she had a sprain on her ankle. Sammy and I rushed towards her and whole crowd had gathered around her. I lifted her up and made her stand.

Jenny: “Oh god it is paining. I think its hurt real bad.”

I: “Lets go to the doctor.”

Jenny: “No doctor please; I will be fine in sometime.”

I: “You seem to be badly hurt and I am taking you to the doctor. I will bring my car and you wait here.”

I made her sit on the park bench. She was limping while walking. I gave strict instructions to Sammy to keep an eye on her and not allow her to move from the place. I went back home and brought my red small car. I went near Jenny and Sammy was sitting down as a guard making sure she doesn’t move from there. I lifted Jenny and put her arm around me and slowly walked with her; Sammy followed us. I made her sit in the front seat and Sammy sat on the back seat. I drove to the hospital while Jenny was crying in pain.

Jenny: “Sammy is such a cruel creature; he just looks innocent; every time I would move on the bench and he would start barking. And you are also mean I said I don’t want to go to any doctor.”

I: “Remember I had said anytime you need any help I will always be there for you and this is the time to help you.”

Jenny: “But…”

I: “But what?”

Jenny: “Nothing. Just drive.”

We were at the hospital; Jenny somehow seemed angry and I had no idea why was she angry. Doctor examined her foot and gave some medicine. He asked her to tie a crape bandage for the entire day and take rest.

Jenny: “No need of any injections?”

Doctor: “It’s a small thing. Just give rest to your leg and you would be fine by tomorrow.”

I: “Thanks doctor.”

We left his place and I helped Jenny get inside the car.

I: “So you are afraid of injections?”

Jenny: “Oh come on I am not afraid of anything.”

I: “Really then why didn’t you wish to come to the hospital.”

Jenny: “I just don’t like seeing sick people around at the hospital.”

I: “Sammy boy who can argue with a beautiful lady who has got hurt just now.”

Sammy woofed and then in sometime we reached Jenny’s place. I helped her get inside the house and explained her roommate that she was hurt. But she seemed indifferent and unmoved and I decided I should take off and stay back with Jenny. I called at my workplace and took an off; went to the medical store and brought medicines mentioned by the doctor. The whole day Sammy and I stayed with Jenny. We spoke about different things; laughed together; Jenny shared stories about her life; about her job; her client; even I shared my stories. The day ended; we had dinner and I bid good bye to Jenny. Next day I saw Jenny come to the park; she was not limping but she was not giving too much stress on her leg. I looked at her and we exchanged smile.

I: “Your leg seems to be fine today.”

Jenny: “Thanks for yesterday.”

I: “Pleasure was all mine.”

And I decided it was time to ask Jenny for my first date. This was the first time I was writing to her and asking her to be my date.

Dear Jenny,

Would you mind to spend another evening with me and eat an average food made by me; get bored with me and have a sparkle in your eyes when you share your favorite moments with me. Would you be my date tonight?

With love,

Sagar.

 

Jenny did not reply to the letter as there was no paper tied around Sammy’s collar and I thought it was a mistake I should not have asked her for the date. I thought the letter was not romantic enough for a date. Suddenly I felt I had lost Jenny and I was sad; I did not know what to do. I went to work and had my usual day and returned back home. I heard a voice but it was not Sammy woofing; I heard a female voice; it was Jenny and she was at my house. It meant she had agreed to be my date; I was excited but suddenly I realized I had to prepare for the date. Jenny was wearing a yellow t-shirt and red skirt with red high heels; she had applied a light makeup on her face and wore a pearl set.

Jenny: “I thought you had asked me for a date and I thought I should help.”

I: “You sit in the hall and just give me an hour. I will prepare everything.”

Jenny: “What if I say everything is ready and you just need to go and get fresh.”

I: “What?”

I was confused and I went inside. I saw the table was set perfectly by her. I could smell the food in the kitchen and I could say the food would taste good from the smell itself. I went inside my room looked for the scented candles which had been gifted to me I don’t really remember by whom and I found them. I arranged the candles on the table and got fresh. I came out and joined Jenny and Sammy.

I: “I hope he did not bother you much.”

Jenny: “He is a darling; he doesn’t bother me and I love his company.”

We kept talking for some time and then we realized that we were hungry and I asked Jenny for dinner. I pulled her chair and make her sit and lit the candles; I went inside the kitchen and brought the food vessel on the table.

Jenny: “I don’t remember bringing those candles.”

I: “That was a surprise. After all we are on a date and how can it complete without these candles.”

Jenny and I enjoyed the dinner and looked into each other’s eyes. We knew we had fallen in love and we had many more dates like this after that. After a year of dating each other Jenny became my legally wedded wife and till date we exchange letters to each other. Sammy is still our messenger who keeps giving our letters and I must thank him because he only brought Jenny and me together. Today is the anniversary of the first day I saw Jenny and I have written a letter to her.

My beloved wife Jenny,

You still have a glowing skin, a beautiful smile, and I enjoy seeing my hand disappear in your black long straight hair. You are the most special woman for me and you make me feel happy every day.

With love,

Your loving husband Sagar.

Jenny replied to this letter.

My loved husband Sagar,

Your compliments still make me flattered. Every day you make me feel young and beautiful. I love the way you touch me; kiss me; hug me. I have treasured every moment spent with you.

Also I have good news which would make you happy. You are going to be a father soon and that would be my gift for you. And yes I would confess today that I am scared of injections but I am sure with you everything will be fine.

With love,

Yours loving wife Jenny.

I was happy to know that I was going to be a father and I was looking forward to our child. Letters had given a new beginning and new meaning to my life. We had a beautiful daughter just like Jenny and even after 10 years of our marriage our letters have continued. Sometimes we express our anger with our letters and our daughter Jeevika has become our messenger of love after Sammy left us 2 years back.
