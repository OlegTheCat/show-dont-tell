Love Letter – The mail that came back nescient

Well not really a story , but a reflection from my past life. A letter I wrote to the estranged love of my life. While I was getting stranded by addiction , getting lost in my expectations with medical education, losing the hold on my music and poetry. And yet it has been 3 years, she never said why it was over, but I never stopped hoping either. Letter writing is almost out of trend but this was my last resort. To the day I don’t know if she read it, but I can just live with the content that she did.
