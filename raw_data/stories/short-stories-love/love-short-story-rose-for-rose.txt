A rose. What does it make you think of? I open the tiny box that sits on the table at the side of my chair. Inside lay a rose, aged yet beautiful, dead yet meaningful. I lift it to my face and draw a breath. The rose has a lingering, sweet scent that stands out amongst many others…

I pull the flower away from my face and reach to stroke its petals. The rose has velvet petals, soft to touch, delightful to the skin. Delicate and tender.

I make my hand move down to the stalk of the rose and quickly draw back as pain travels down my fingers. For every beauty comes with an element of danger. The rose has thorns so treacherous that they can cause wounds deep and beyond repair.

Now, I feel a single tear slide down my cheek and watch it as it drops onto the rose. The rose no longer has a scent that filled the air and lingered, making you happy; its petals no longer were velvety under my touch but rather felt like stiff, singed cotton. The blood red colouring had leaked away and now all that was left was brown. The memories were fading. But the thorns were still sharp and the pain still fresh. The wounds were still raw and would never heal.

And somewhere out there, Rose lay still in her coffin, aged yet beautiful, dead yet meaningful. She who had made me feel safe, like every moment of my life was worth living. She had also given me infinite hurt. It was hard to take in. Rose and I would never be together again. Rose was but a memory etched into my brain. Died, faded and withered into the past. Yes, withered, like the rose she had left upon my pillow…

THE END
