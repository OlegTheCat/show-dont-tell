Have you ever felt so in love with someone that you would do anything for them? You would die for them, but they do not feel the same. You tell them how you feel but they push you away. You wonder why? You sit on your bed and wonder why he does not feel the same way.

It all started in kindergarten. I was just a little girl minding her own business. Then, this little boy and I start playing. We were best friends all through high school. He only thought of me as a friend but I did not just see him as a friend. There was a feeling that I always had for him. This warm fuzzy feeling. I tried to just forget about the feeling but it was too overwhelming to forget.

When it was time for college we were so excited because we were accepted into the same college. The first few months of college were amazing, but then he met this girl. He felt that warm fuzzy feeling when he saw her. The same exact feelings I have for him. I acted all excited for him, but actually I was crying on the inside. I never thought a heart break would hurt this bad.

One night him and I went to a party. Around 2am we both wanted to go home so we went back to his apartment. We were both buzzed but not drunk. I was standing at the counter in his kitchen when he enveloped me into his arms. He was holding me so tight I thought my heart was going to explode. He then slowly moved my hair and kissed my neck. He then brought me into his bedroom and shut the door. Spending the rest of the night together.

The next morning I woke up. He was not in bed with me so I got up and went into the living room. I found him sitting on the couch with his girlfriend. He looked at me and saw that my heart was broken. He jumped up and held me in his arms. I loudly screamed “WHEN WILL YOU LOVE ME?” I ran into the kitchen took the kitchen knife and stuck it into my broken heart.
