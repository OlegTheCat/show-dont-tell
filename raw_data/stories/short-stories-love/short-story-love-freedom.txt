Short Story Love – The Freedom

Two years passed like two minutes. Where are you now Shounak? Come and see how happy I am without you. Today somehow I feel, kicking you out of my life was the best decision taken ever.

After break-up, I actually got time rather the scope to look at myself in a different way. Better to say, that phase taught me to accept things as it ought to be. And yes, though needless to inform you I couldn’t join the broken pieces of my heart yet. Not because your place is still there in my mind. Only ‘cause I want to remind myself of the biggest mistake I did, the mistake of trusting you blindly.

My mind was caged by your thoughts. Now, I’m a free-spirit, having none but myself to justify. Hold on, neither did you ever ask for the cause of my actions nor did I. Such was our mutual respect. Then what went wrong???……

“I have died everyday waiting for you,

Darling don’t be afraid I have love you

For a thousand years.”

The alarm rang. Kaushani rolled in bed, grabbed the phone and stopped it. Time was just 6:20am. She has the privilege to sleep for ten more minutes. “The pillow seems wet. Not again!” she told herself. Shedding tears dreaming about old days has become a daily routine almost.

Suddenly Kaushani felt a funny jolt in her stomach, hugging the pillow she hid her pink face in bed. Today is 1

 September, her first day of internship at victor moses & co, one of the best law firms at Kolkata. Being a bright student, it was not difficult for her to grab the opportunity of interning over there.

“The real struggle at Black & White world starts today.” She muttered to herself. She was nervous, yet confident. Betrayal has grown her up gradually into strong, independent and confident lass. Instead of crying over the despairs of past, Kaushani was enjoying the “Freedom”, of her free soul.  But whom does she justify every night? Who else other than her broken self!
