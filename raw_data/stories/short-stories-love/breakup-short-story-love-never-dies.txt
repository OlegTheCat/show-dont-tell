4th January’14

Happy anniversary my love, said Abhi.

Thank you baby. Wow, we’ve tolerated each other for four damn years. I’m soo happy. Happy anniversary my cutie, said Ayesha.

They talked whole night that day and talked about the topsy turvy 4 years of their relationship. Both were elated to be with each other and discussed about their future, their plans to walk down the aisle and having lil devils of their own. Both of them planned to take an off from their busy schedule of work so as to celebrate the four years of togetherness.

Oh, I forgot to mention that Abhi has shifted to Delhi and he is a successful engineer now, working with some company in Noida and Ayesha is a soft skills trainer who is adored by every student of hers.

The next day they met and went to watch a movie and then they went to have lunch.

Ayesha : I wanna get high, can I have some vodka shots?

Abhi : take me to your home and then ill tell you the best way of getting high ;)

Ayesha : Shut up, and please order shots for me.

Abhi : As u say ma’am J

They had a gala time while having their drinks and food. the cold chilling weather of January, the drinks and the amazing ambiance made their day a super amazing one.

Abhi : So baby, are we going to your home??

Ayesha (a lil tipsy) : Have I ever said no to you ?

Abhi : I love you sexy!!!

Ayesha : I’m already taking you home, you don’t have to cajole me anymore.

Abhi : I seriously do love you girl.

Ayesha : Awww baby..muuaahhh :*

They came home and spent 2 hours at her place and had amazing moments. It wasn’t for the first time that they had spent time at her palce like this. Since Ayesha parents’ don’t use to be at home because of their work so Abhi came often at her place.

Ayesha (while lying next to him on bed ) : Abhi, we will get married for sure. I just can’t think of anyone else except you. I can’t love anyone as I love you. I would never let anyone even come closer to me and touch me.

Abhi (wiping her tears ): Ayesha, I love you and I would do anything to marry you, I know I don’t say it often but yes I realy love you a lot. You have made me a better person, I owe my success to you. Yo have always been with me through thick and thin. You have even ignored my flings with other girls that I had while dating you. You are the best thing to have happened to me.

They hugged and kissed each other and then Abhi left.

Ayesha was ecstatic as she had had an amazing day with him.. Reminiscing the past she thinks over how the time has changed..

How Abhi, who was once a Casanova, had fallen for her and has got dreams to marry her and have kids with her.

There had been times when Ayesha and Abhi fought, broke up, patched n broke up again. Sometimes it was Abhi who was at fault or you can say did BLUNDERS or Ayesha who made things worse because of her impulsive nature.

Ayesha always ignored Abhi’s habit of flirting around with girls and Abhi always ignored the annoyance created by Ayesha, so in a nutshell they were a made for each other couple, in Ayesha’s words a cute adorable and an item couple. They both knew how to handle each other at their worst and how to love each other at their best.

Time passed by and things were going smoothly in between them.

 

3rd May’14

Abhi loves me, Abhi loves me not, Abhi loves me, Abhi loves me not..

Ayesha (with a sad tone) : Ishika, he doesn’t love me.

Ishika : Oh, tell me something new Ayesha. I already knew that.

Ayesha : Why doesn’t he love me? I love him a lot Ishika. I just can’t imagine my life without him.

Ishika : Oh, c’mon Ayesha, you gotta accept the reality now. I don’t want you to stay in a denial anymore. It has been 3 months, he dint even care to call you once to ask abt ur well being and don’t even forget that the so called love of your life even didn’t care about your b’day. I don’t want to make u feel bad otherwise I would have given you a really good reality check.

Ayesha (with tears in her eyes) : I still love him a lot. I know he has been a jerk for 3 months now but I feel somewhere or the other he too loves me but destiny doesn’t want us to be together. And anyway, whether he loves me or not, my love for him is still the same, I just wish all the happiness for him.

Ishika : I’m gonna kill that f**king ba**ard some day, I cant see my bestie like this.

Ayesha: Don’t you even dare to think like that.

Ishika: I know you would hate me if I ever do that, So I’ve decided that after murdering ur love, I’ll commit suicide, otherwise you’ll kill me.

Ayesha : No, please don’t commit suicide. I would get hell lot of bored if you won’t be there. After all tu hi toh meri dost hai.

Ishika : F**k you b**ch, am I there for entertainment only??

Ayesha : Hahahaha.. I love you baby :*

Yes, you read it right Abhi and Ayesha have broken up. Remember Ayesha’s words that she doesn’t want to be with Abhi anymore.

 

26th January’14

Abhi : hello babe..

Ayesha : hii baby.. I’m not talking to you..

Abhi : now what Ayesha?

Ayesha : just because I want you to pamper me.

Abhi : And why should I do that?

Ayesha : Just because I want you to do that.

Abhi : I’m too tired Ayesha.

Ayesha : You never pamper me. I hate you.

Abhi : Feelings are mutual sweetheart.

Ayesha : I’m sure Abhi, there would come a day when u’ll do every possible thing just to pamper me, to make me feel special and I would also have a carefree attitude like yours that day.

Abhi : Good luck baby.

Ayesha : I called you last night, why didn’t you answer my cal?

Abhi : I had slept as I was exhausted.

Ayesha : Awww, my baby worked a lot yesterday?

Abhi : No, I had an off. I had gone to Indian Habitat Center for breakfast and then I had gone to play badminton with friends.

Ayesha ( a lil hurt and angry ) : what? U had an off? M angry with you.. We were supposed to meet and just because of all your scene, you didn’t meet me. I’ll speak to you later. Bye.

Abhi : What Ayesha?

Ayesha : I’ll call you back in a while. Bye.

Abhi : Bye.

Abhi got infuriated after this conversation and whatsapped Ayesha, Not to call him that very night and even if she would, he wouldn’t answer the call.

Ayesha took all this lightly and told him that if he wouldn’t answer the call that very night so she would do the same when he would call her.

Ayesha called him at night but Abhi didn’t answer the call.

The next five days Abhi messaged her good morning as it was a part of their daily schedule to wish each other every morning. But Ayesha didn’t reply.

Ayesha had got a new job so she was busy with her farewell party at her previous office and with the other various things for her new job. She had oodles of things to do so she ignored what was going on between her and Abhi.

She had to join her new office on 1st Feb’14, she was expecting a text from Abhi that day. But unfortunately, Abhi didn’t live upto her expectations as usual. She was a lot disappointed.After 2-3 days, she called him up. But he didn’t answer the cal.

Ayesha : Are you going to call or should I hit the sack?

Abhi : sleep.

Ayesha : Ok. I miss you.

Days passed but Abhi didn’t look back now, Ayesha again called him up and same thing happened. Ayesha texted him to talk to her. It was around 1 at night, he called from his office and told her that message me for 5 days and get to know how does it feel when you message someone and that person doesn’t reply and then I’ll talk to you and then he banged the phone.

Ayesha kept wondering about Abhi’s words and texted him that she would message him. First two days she messaged him expressing his anger and disappointment and 1 day she messaged him this

“Sunday says I miss you.

Monday says u r a dog

Tuesdays says but still I love you

Wednesday asks now will you talk to me?

Thursday says Abhi is still angry

Friday says mission accomplished, Ayesha has messaged for 5 days

I texted you in 1 go for the whole week..now please talk to me”

Ayesha texted 1 more day and thought since she has called or texted earlier so 5 days are completed but it wasn’t so. When to her expectations Abhi didn’t call or text, she got really angry and this time she decided that she doesn’t want to continue this relation anymore as she doesn’t have any importance in his life.

Then she texted him- Abhi I don’t want to be with you anymore. Thanx for everything. Tkcr.

Abhi replied in an angry tone- don’t throw such tantrums at me, go to some one else and do that. I can’t take this nonsense anymore.

After this incident, Ayesha tried thrice to talk to him, but things remained same. He neither took her calls nor replied to texts.

One day he messaged her and said he appreciates that she took initiative of making things fine but now according to him things couldn’t get fine.

She thought things would get fine on her b’day which was right after 3 weeks, 23rd March. Unexpectedly, Abhi just called her around 12:30 am and wished and exchanged few words, nothing else nothing more. That was the day when Ayesha had a rush of emotions and cried the most.

Ishika was there to celebrate her b’day, she handled her and made her day a special day for her.

The wait was yet not over for Ayesha, though after her b’day things were evident but Ayesha ignored and still had hopes.

On 13th April, after coming from her friend’s cocktail party, she texted abhi again but Abhi told her since it has been 2.5 months that they didn’t talk so now he feels things can never work out between them.

The last text that she sent to Abhi read-

“We haven’t talked for 2.5 months but we were in a relationship for 4 years. Anyways if ever you feel like things can get work out between us, remember I’m always there.tkcr.”

 

4th May’14

Ayesha has visited several temples and gurudwara to pray so as to make thigns fine between them. She has been to several tarot card readers to ask abt both of them. Though she has always got a positive response but looking at her present she z a bit reluctant as she feels Abhi is involved with some other girl as he stays online whole night on whatsap and doent even care to talk to Ayesha.

Ayesha wrote few lines while thinking of Abhi

So what if I can’t have you,

I can still have you in my dreams and fascinations.

So what if I’ve lost all the rights on you,

I still have the rights of your memories and the moments that we spent together.

So what if I’m not there for you,

You have her to love you and care for you.

So what if we can’t be together,

We had stayed together in past which is enough for me for my future.

This is all about Ayesha Abhi’s story till now. Ayesha is still waiting for Abhi to come back as she really loves him a lot, meanwhile her parents are bugging her with the wedding thing and she has been been ignoring it. Throughout the day Abhi is on her mind. But still smile, she laughs and she enjoys because she doesn’t want to trouble her family and family because of all this. From inside she is all shattered.

Guys please pray that Abhi and Ayesha get back together and sort out all the differences between them.
