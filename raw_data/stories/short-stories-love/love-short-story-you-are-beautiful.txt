‘TRINGG! TRINGG!!!”

Kabir picked up Zoyas call.

” HELLO !!! Babe i missed you so much in the past week …..but i will return tomorrow only ”

” Kabir,” Zoya started with a soft voice ” You are the best guy i have seen till now. You have the power to do miracles. My life touched by you became alive. I am glad I got someone like you to call as my first love. I love you, I always will. But some relations aren’t meant forever. Kabir its time to end our journey. Good bye love, never try calling me again, our ways shall part now. But I will fulfill any one last wish of yours, tell me whats it? ”

Kabir was dumbstruck. He had gone to Singapore for a business tour. What had happened meanwhile that his love had decided to breakup. He could just say ‘ Zoya I wanna meet you . One last time. I will reach Delhi tomorrow and i hope you will be able to come at 6 pm.”

” Okay I will ” Zoya cut the call.

Both of them were crying for some reason.

The next day after Kabir was back, at 6 pm sharp Zoya came at his place. But unusually, she was wearing a burkha. Shocked to see her like that Kabir asked ,’ Whats this Zoya?”

No response.

” Zoya!!!”

No response.

Irritably, Kabir uncovered the burkha from here face and there he saw the face, burnt on left side. Zoya burst out crying. Kabir hugged her tight. He knew she needed him.

After a minute, Zoya shouted ,’ Tell me Kabir, would you like me to be ur girlfriend anymore? I am so ugly!!”

Kabir replied, ” No I wont want you as my girlfriend anymore……..I would WANT YOU AS MY WIFE!”

Kabir took out a ring and kissed Zoya’s burnt side of face and said ” YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL  ”
