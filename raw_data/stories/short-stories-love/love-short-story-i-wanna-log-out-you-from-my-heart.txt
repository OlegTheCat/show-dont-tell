When I was trying to construct the equation of her beauty the bus left the bus stop. Wait, wait, wait …I should start from here…

It was six in the morning when I unlocked my adjacent window of my college bus. Then what I saw that was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. That was a girl, sorry the most beautiful girl. After seeing her, my heart tilted to some non-measurable angles. She was just like a replica of a light wave reflecting infinitely. I have a habit of sleeping in the bus during journey. But that day her infectious beauty acts as an anti-sleeping pill. I couldn’t sleep at all. In my busy life I was able to forget that sweet incident.

In the next day my mind reinstalled when I looked the same pretty girl standing at the same bus stop at the same time. It was my college bus, otherwise I could wish her to get into the bus and travel with me to her destination. This process was going on next six days. I found her every day in the morning in that bus stop. During those days she also had noticed me and blew smile over me. Her smile was prominently telling me something that she might have still a status of single in her Facebook profile. My little greedy eyes couldn’t stop to watch her again and again. My heart affected by some kind of malware. I seem to lack enthusiasm for the work I was doing. I want to hack into her heart. The tenure of my patience came to an end. My mind was frequently telling to my heart to get down from the bus in the next morning and directly proposed her

The next day, it was a Saturday, as usual I got my bus and heading towards my workplace. That day I had decided to speak out my feelings to my most beautiful girl. So many questions were arising in my mind. And that every question has a link to- whether that girl will accept me or not…..

I am a normal guy. I am the definition of it. I don’t go to the gym. I don’t cycle. I don’t dance or sing very well. I am not successful. I just live, wake up hear about the great things people do, and I go back to sleep. I am quite extraordinary that way.

But it all changes that day I met her. Frankly speaking I loved her. If there is something I have tried really hard, it’s to fall out of love with her and it didn’t happen.

Finally I had reached at the bus stop where she waits for her bus. My eyes could not search her because there was a big crowed. I thought something awful happened there. Anyway I get down. I entered into the crowed. I suddenly found her with three more girls. They all covered with their face with scarfs. A police van and three policemen are there on the spot. I couldn’t calculate in my mind what was happening. From the gather I asked some one. What I heard from her that completely made my feelings volatile. Yup! Those four girls were arrested in a raid carried out in a nearby hotel.

I whisper myself…I was in love with a prostitute!
