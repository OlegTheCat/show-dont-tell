I am the medicine of your aching heart!

 Bandage of the broken part .

 all u need to do is sit still,

 all i will do is fill.

 Fill the broken part,

 with my own heart .

 But, Don’t compare my love with her,

 she’ll give you thorns but begin with fur!

AGAIN? yeah I fell in love again and this time it was again one-sided.

True one-sided love is one of the biggest mistake you’d do but you know what there is a bright side to it.

You don’t have expectations.

Often we kill ourselves with those expectations, because we expect our loved ones to do the things for us without saying and when that doesn’t happen we have an emotional breakdown or depression.

LOVE they say is a pure feeling, eternal and divine . And it is indeed, when someone loves you ,you feel special but when that someone loves all equally, don’t feel bad, feel special .

According to me it was in my destiny to meet him. during the initial days we hated each other . But now everything has changed and so has life. We are best of friends, each time spent with him paints itself on the canvas of my heart and brain .Each hand shake, smile, hug, gift, laughter, anger adds up as a new flavor to my life. Each moment converts itself to a memory. Often I feel afraid of losing him but then i go up to the first line of this paragraph. And tell myself to stop else it will happen again, the cycle of love will paddle again and the wheels of heart will move ahead.

But what happens when the first mistake comes infront of you after 3 years? Gonna chose your first love or the one you love now?

 Life makes you stand often on ways which are further divided two..when taking decision consider your future too.
